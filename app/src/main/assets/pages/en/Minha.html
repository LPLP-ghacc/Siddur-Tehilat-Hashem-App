<h3>GIVE THANKS TO THE L-RD BECAUSE HE IS GOOD, FOR HIS KINDNESS IS ETERNAL.
    THOSE REDEEMED BY THE L-RD SHALL SAY IT, THOSE WHOM HE REDEEMED FROM THE HANDS OF AN OPPRESSOR.
    AND GATHERED THEM FROM LANDS, FROM THE EAST AND FROM THE WEST, FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE SEA.
    THEY STRAYED IN THE DESERT, ON A ROAD OF DESOLATION; THEY DID NOT FIND AN INHABITED CITY.
    HUNGRY AS WELL AS THIRSTY, THEIR SOUL ENWRAPS ITSELF IN THEM.
    AND THEY CRIED OUT TO THE L-RD IN THEIR DISTRESS; FROM THEIR STRAITS HE RESCUED THEM.
    AND HE LED THEM ON A STRAIGHT ROAD, TO GO TO AN INHABITED CITY.
    THEY SHALL GIVE THANKS TO THE L-RD FOR HIS KINDNESS, AND FOR HIS WONDERS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN.
    FOR HE SATED A YEARNING SOUL, AND A HUNGRY SOUL HE FILLED WITH GOODNESS.
    THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, PRISONERS OF AFFLICTION AND IRON.
    FOR THEY REBELLED AGAINST THE WORDS OF GOD, AND THEY SCORNED THE COUNSEL OF THE MOST HIGH.
    AND HE HUMBLED THEIR HEART WITH TOIL; THEY STUMBLED WITH NO ONE TO HELP THEM.
    AND THEY CRIED OUT TO THE L-RD IN THEIR DISTRESS; FROM THEIR STRAITS HE SAVED THEM.
    HE TOOK THEM OUT OF DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, AND HE BROKE OPEN THEIR BONDS.
    THEY SHALL GIVE THANKS TO THE L-RD FOR HIS KINDNESS, AND FOR HIS WONDERS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN.
    FOR HE BROKE COPPER DOORS, AND CUT OFF IRON BARS.
    FOOLS, BECAUSE OF THE WAY OF THEIR TRANSGRESSION AND BECAUSE OF THEIR INIQUITIES, ARE AFFLICTED.
    THEIR SOUL DESPISES ALL FOOD, AND THEY REACH THE PORTALS OF DEATH.
    AND THEY CRIED OUT TO THE L-RD IN THEIR DISTRESS; FROM THEIR STRAITS HE SAVED THEM.
    HE SENT HIS WORD AND HEALED THEM, AND EXTRICATED THEM FROM THEIR PIT.
    THEY SHALL GIVE THANKS TO THE L-RD FOR HIS KINDNESS, AND FOR HIS WONDERS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN.
    AND THEY SHALL SLAUGHTER SACRIFICES OF THANKSGIVING, AND THEY SHALL TELL OF HIS DEEDS WITH SONG.
    THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS, WHO DO WORK IN MIGHTY WATERS.
    THEY SAW THE DEEDS OF THE L-RD AND HIS WONDERS IN THE DEEP.
    HE SPOKE, AND HE SET UP A TEMPEST, AND IT RAISED ITS WAVES.
    THEY WENT UP TO THE HEAVENS, THEY CAME DOWN TO THE DEPTHS; THEIR SOUL MELTED WITH TROUBLE.
    THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND STAGGERED LIKE A DRUNKARD, AND ALL THEIR WISDOM WAS DESTROYED.
    THEY CRIED OUT TO THE L-RD FROM THEIR DISTRESS, THAT HE TAKE THEM OUT OF THEIR STRAITS.
    THE TEMPEST HE HAD SET UP SETTLED INTO A CALM, AND THEIR WAVES WERE STILLED.
    THEY REJOICED THAT THEY WERE STILLED, AND HE LED THEM TO THE REGION OF THEIR DESIRE.
    THEY SHALL THANK THE L-RD FOR HIS KINDNESS, AND FOR HIS WONDERS TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN.
    AND THEY SHALL EXALT HIM IN AN ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLE, AND IN A SITTING OF ELDERS, PRAISE HIM.
    HE MAKES RIVERS INTO A DESERT, AND SPRINGS OF WATER INTO AN ARID PLACE;
    A FRUITFUL LAND INTO A SALTY WASTE, BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF ITS INHABITANTS.
    HE MAKES A DESERT INTO A POOL OF WATER, AND A WASTELAND INTO SPRINGS OF WATER.
    AND HE SETTLES THE HUNGRY THERE, AND THEY ESTABLISH AN INHABITED CITY.
    AND THEY SOW FIELDS AND PLANT VINEYARDS, WHICH PRODUCE FRUITS AND GRAIN.
    AND HE BLESSED THEM, AND THEY MULTIPLIED EXCEEDINGLY, AND THEIR ANIMALS DID NOT DECREASE.
    WHEREAS THEY WERE FEW AND THEY SANK DOWN FROM DOMINION, TROUBLE, AND SORROW.
    HE POURS CONTEMPT UPON PRINCES AND LEADS THEM ASTRAY IN A WASTELAND WHERE THERE IS NO PATH.
    AND HE STRENGTHENED THE NEEDY FROM POVERTY AND MADE HIM FAMILIES LIKE FLOCKS.
    THE UPRIGHT SEE AND REJOICE, AND ALL INJUSTICE SHUTS ITS MOUTH.
    HE WHO IS WISE WILL KEEP THESE IN MIND, AND THEY WILL PONDER THE KIND DEEDS OF THE L-RD.
</h3>

<h3 class="hint">When Friday falls on Yom-Tom or Chol-ha-Moed, start here:</h3>
<h3>THE PROPHET ELIYAHU, OF BLESSED MEMORY, OPENED, AND SAID:
    ETERNAL HIDDEN MASTER OF THE WORLDS! YOU ARE HE WHOSE UNITY IS INFINITE AND ABSOLUTE, AND THEREFORE INDIVISIBLE. YOU ARE HE THE FIRST CAUSE, TRANSCENDENT BEYOND ALL THAT IS ABOVE, AND CONCEALED BEHIND ALL THAT IS CONCEALED. NO THOUGHT WHATSOEVER CAN GRASP YOU.
    BUT YOU ARE HE WHO BROUGHT FORTH TEN RECTIFICATIONS - WE CALL THEM THE TEN SEFIROT ATZILUT - WITH WHICH TO REGULATE THE POWERFUL ILLUMINATION OF YOUR LIGHT THAT FLOWS DOWN THROUGH HIDDEN WORLDS THAT ARE NOT REVEALED THE WORLDS OF ADAM KADMON AND ATZILUT, AS WELL AS WORLDS THAT ARE REVEALED BERIYA, YETZIRA AND ASIYA. INDEED, IT IS THROUGH THESE THE TEN SEFIROT OF EACH UNIVERSE THAT YOU ARE HIDDEN FROM HUMAN BEINGS SO THEY CAN EXIST AND NOT BE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR LIGHT. YOU ARE HE WHO BINDS THEM SEFIROT TOGETHER AND UNIFIES THEM TO YOURSELF. AND INASMUCH AS YOU ARE WITHIN THEM, ANYONE WHO SEPARATES ONE FROM THE OTHER IS REGARDED AS HAVING CAUSED A SEPARATION IN YOU AND YOUR ABSOLUTE UNITY.
    THESE TEN SEFIROT ARE ARRANGED IN A SPECIAL ORDER OF THREE COLUMNS. THE RIGHT COLUMN IS SAID TO BE "LONG" BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS YOUR LOVE AND KINDNESS. THE LEFT COLUMN IS SAID TO BE "SHORT" BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS YOUR JUDGMENT AND POWER OF RESTRAINT AND WITHDRAWAL. THE MIDDLE COLUMN OR TRUNK IS SAID TO BE "INTERMEDIATE" BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS YOUR MERCY, THE PERFECT HARMONY OF LOVE AND RESTRAINT. IN THIS WAY, THE TEN SEFIROT ARE CONDUITS THROUGH WHICH YOU REGULATE YOUR INTERACTION WITH HUMAN BEINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS. ABOVE ALL IT IS YOU ALONE WHO DIRECTS THEM. THERE IS NO POWER THAT DIRECTS YOU - NEITHER ABOVE NOR BELOW, NOR FROM ANY DIRECTION.
    THE TEN SEFIROT OF ATZILUT THUS CONSTITUTE ONE ENTIRE SYSTEM OR "BODY", AND YOU ARE THE SOUL THAT FILLS IT AND DIRECTS IT. JUST AS THE HUMAN BODY DISGUISES THE INTENSITY OF THE SOUL, THE SEFIROT SERVE TO DISGUISE AND CONCEAL YOUR LIGHT. YOU ALSO ARRANGED A SYSTEM OF THREE LOWER WORLDS, BERIYA, YETZIRA, AND ASIYA, THAT SERVE AS "GARMENTS" TO FURTHER COVER OVER THE SEFIROT OF ATZILUT AND PROTECT US FROM THE INTENSITY OF YOUR LIGHT. IT IS FROM THESE "GARMENTS" THAT THE SOULS NESHAMA, RUACH AND NEFESH OF HUMAN BEINGS ORIGINATE.
    THE SEFIROT OF ATZILUT ARE CLOTHED WITHIN THESE "GARMENTS", AND FOR THIS REASON THEY ARE CALLED "LIMBS" OF A "BODY" RELATIVE TO THE "CLOTHES" THAT COVER OVER THEM. THESE "LIMBS" ARE ARRANGED AS FOLLOWS: CHESED (OR LOVING-KINDNESS) IS THE RIGHT ARM, GEVURA (RESTRAINT) IS THE LEFT ARM, AND TIFERET (HARMONY) IS THE TORSO. NETZACH (DOMINANCE) AND HOD (EMPATHY) ARE THE TWO LEGS, AND YESOD (FOUNDATION OR CHANNEL) IS THE BODY'S EXTREMITY, THE SIGN OF THE HOLY COVENANT. MALCHUT (KINGSHIP) IS THE MOUTH OF THE HOLY COVENANT. IT IS THEREFORE CALLED THE "ORAL TORAH".
    ABOVE THESE "LIMBS" IS THE "HEAD" IN WHICH CHOCHMA (WISDOM) IS THE RIGHT BRAIN, THE SEAT OF THOUGHT, AND BINA (UNDERSTANDING) IS THE LEFT BRAIN AND THE HEART, THE HEART'S ABILITY TO DISCERN. CONCERNING THESE, IT IS WRITTEN, "THE HIDDEN THINGS BELONG TO G‑D CORRESPONDING TO CHOCHMA OUR G‑D CORRESPONDING TO BINA". (DEUT. 29:28)
    KETER ELYON (SUPERNAL CROWN) IS THE KETER OF MALCHUT, CONCERNING WHICH IT IS SAID, "I G‑D DECLARE THE END FROM THE BEGINNING". (ISAIAH 46:10). KETER SURROUNDS AND CONTAINS THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN, CHOCHMA AND BINA, LIKE THE LEATHER BOX OF THE TEFILLIN THAT SURROUNDS AND CONTAINS THE PARCHMENTS.
    WITHIN THIS UNIFIED SYSTEM OF "LIMBS" AND "HEAD" WHICH CONSTITUTE ONE "BODY" OR "TREE," IS THE DIVINE NAME "SPELLED-OUT" WITH ALEFS, I.E. MAH, THUS:
    YUD-VAV-DALET = 20, HEI-ALEF = 6, VAV-ALEF-VAV= 13, HEI-ALEF= 6.
    WITH THIS NAME YOU DETERMINE THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR LIGHT IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE SEFIROT OF ATZILUT. THIS NAME THEREFORE FILLS AND SATURATES THE "ROOTS" AND THE "TRUNK" OF THE "TREE" OF THE SEFIROT, TOGETHER WITH ITS "LIMBS" AND "BRANCHES", AS WATER IRRIGATES AND SATURATES A TREE. THE "TREE" THEN GROWS IN PROPORTION TO HOW MUCH "WATER" FLOWS THROUGH IT.
    ETERNAL HIDDEN MASTER OF THE WORLDS, YOU ARE THE SUPREME CAUSE OF ALL CAUSES AND THE ORIGIN OF ALL EFFECTS! YOU WATER THE TREE WITH THAT FLOW. AND THAT FLOW IS THE VERY LIFE-FORCE OF THE "TREE" - LIKE A SOUL TO A BODY. BUT NO "HUMAN" LIKENESS OR "BODILY" IMAGE EXISTS IN YOUR INFINITE ESSENCE WITH WHICH WE MIGHT LIKEN YOU TO ANYTHING WITHIN OR WITHOUT.
    YOU ALONE CREATED THE STARRY GALAXIES AND THE EARTH. FROM THE GALAXIES ABOVE, YOU BROUGHT FORTH SUN AND MOON, PLANETS AND STARRY CONSTELLATIONS. ON THE EARTH BELOW, YOU BROUGHT FORTH TREES AND PLANTS, THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND FIELDS OF GRASS, LIVING CREATURES, BIRDS AND FISH, ANIMALS AND HUMANITY.
    THROUGH THEM THROUGH ALL THAT EXISTS BELOW, YOU MAKE KNOWN THAT WHICH IS ABOVE. YOU ALSO MAKE KNOWN HOW ALL THAT IS ABOVE IN ATZILUT AND BELOW IN BERIYA, YETZIRA AND ASIYA IS REGULATED, AND HOW THE HIGHER WORLDS MAY BE KNOWN FROM THE LOWER BUT KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ESSENCE IS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU THERE IS NO UNITY IN THE HIGHER OR LOWER REALMS YOU ARE THEREFORE KNOWN AS THE CAUSE OF ALL AND THE MASTER OF ALL.
    EACH SEFIRA CORRESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC DIVINE NAME OR ATTRIBUTE, AND IT IS WITH THESE NAMES THAT ANGELS ARE CALLED OR, IT IS WITH THESE NAMES THAT ANGELS CAN BE CALLED DOWN. YOU, HOWEVER, ARE BEYOND ANY NAME, FOR YOU ARE HE WHO PERMEATES THEM ALL, AND YOU ARE HE WHO PERFECTS THEM ALL. THEREFORE, WHEN YOU WITHHOLD YOUR LIGHT FROM THE SEFIROT, ALL THE NAMES REMAIN AS EMPTY VESSELS, LIKE A "BODY" DEVOID OF "SOUL".
    AS FOR YOU, YOU ARE INTRINSICALLY WISE, BUT NOT WITH A KNOWABLE ATTRIBUTE OF WISDOM. YOU UNDERSTAND, BUT WITHOUT A KNOWABLE ATTRIBUTE OF UNDERSTANDING. NO "PLACE" CAN CONTAIN YOU YOU CLOTHED YOURSELF IN THE SEFIROT ONLY IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR MASTERY AND POWER KNOWN TO HUMAN BEINGS AND TO SHOW THEM HOW THE WORLD IS CONDUCTED THROUGH JUSTICE AND MERCY - I.E. THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUDGMENT ARE METED OUT IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE ACTIONS OF MEN.
    THE SEVEN LOWER SEFIROT ARE ALSO LIKENED TO A SCALE, WHEREIN CHESED CORRESPONDS TO THE RIGHT ARM OF THE SCALE. DIN I.E. JUSTICE IS GEVURA THE LEFT ARM. MISHPAT I.E. JUDGMENT IS THE MIDDLE COLUMN MERCY, TIFERET. RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE HOLY MALCHUT THE BASE OF THE SCALES. THE SCALES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE THE TWO PILLARS OF TRUTH. THE MEASURE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE SIGN OF THE HOLY COVENANT YESOD. ALL OF THESE TOGETHER SHOW HOW YOU CONDUCT THE WORLD RELATIVE TO MAN, BUT NOT THAT YOU YOURSELF POSSESS A KNOWABLE QUALITY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH WHICH TO BE JUST. NEITHER DO YOU POSSESS AN ATTRIBUTE OF JUDGMENT WITH WHICH TO BE MERCIFUL. THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL THESE QUALITIES. MAY THE ETERNAL G‑D BE BLESSED AND REVEALED IN THIS WORLD AND FOREVER MORE, AMEN AND AMEN.
</h3>
<h3>
    BELOVED OF THE SOUL, COMPASSIONATE FATHER, DRAW YOUR SERVANT TO YOUR WILL. THEN YOUR SERVANT WILL HURRY LIKE A HART TO BOW BEFORE YOUR MAJESTY. TO HIM YOUR FRIENDSHIP WILL BE SWEETER THAN THE DRIPPING OF THE HONEYCOMB AND ALL TASTE.
    MAJESTIC, BEAUTIFUL, RADIANCE OF THE UNIVERSE MY SOUL IS SICK FOR YOUR LOVE. PLEASE O G‑D, HEAL HER NOW BY SHOWING HER THE PLEASANTNESS OF YOUR RADIANCE. THEN SHE WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND HEALED AND ETERNAL GLADNESS WILL BE HERS.
    ALL WORTHY ONE — MAY YOUR MERCY BE AROUSED AND PLEASE TAKE PITY ON THE SON OF YOUR BELOVED, BECAUSE IT IS SO VERY LONG THAT I HAVE YEARNED INTENSELY TO SEE THE SPLENDOR OF YOUR STRENGTH, ONLY THESE MY HEART DESIRED, SO PLEASE TAKE PITY AND DO NOT CONCEAL YOURSELF.
    PLEASE BE REVEALED AND SPREAD UPON ME, MY BELOVED, THE SHELTER OF YOUR PEACE THAT WE MAY REJOICE AND BE GLAD WITH YOU. HASTEN, BE LOVED, FOR THE TIME HAS COME, AND SHOW US GRACE AS IN DAYS OF OLD.

<h1>THE L-RD SPOKE TO MOSES AND GAVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS TO TELL THE JEWISH NATION: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY TO THEM: FOR MY OFFERING-WHICH IS LIKE MY FOOD FOR MY FIRES ON THE ALTAR, AND WHOSE SMELL IS PLEASING TO ME WHEN YOU OFFER IT-YOU SHOULD APPOINT KOHANIM AND LEVITES TO TAKE CARE TO OFFER IT TO ME AT ITS PROPER TIME, EVERY MORNING AND AFTERNOON. YOU SHOULD TELL THE COURT OF LAW TO INSTRUCT THE JEWISH NATION: THIS IS THE FIRE-BURNT OFFERING THAT YOU SHOULD OFFER TO THE L-RD: TWO LAMBS THAT ARE LESS THAN A YEAR OLD AND UNBLEMISHED, OFFERED EACH DAY AS A DAILY BURNT-OFFERING, TO BE COMPLETELY CONSUMED BY THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR. PREPARE THE FIRST LAMB TO BE OFFERED IN THE MORNING AND THE SECOND LAMB TO BE OFFERED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. ALONG WITH THIS OFFERING, YOU SHOULD OFFER A TENTH OF AN EPHAH (ABOUT NINE CUPS) OF FINE FLOUR AS A FLOUR-OFFERING, MIXED WITH A QUARTER OF A HIN (ABOUT FOUR CUPS) OF OIL FROM CRUSHED OLIVES. THAT IS THE DAILY BURNT-OFFERING, THE WAY IT WAS DONE WHEN THE JEWISH NATION BUILT THE SANCTUARY AND WERE NEXT TO MOUNT SINAI. THE DAILY BURNT-OFFERING IS A HIRE-OFFERING, OFFERED TO MAKE A PLEASING SMELL FOR THE L-RD. ALONG WITH THE FIRST LAMB, OFFERED IN THE MORNING, OFFER A WINE-OFFERING OF A QUARTER OF A HIN (ABOUT FOUR CUPS). POUR THIS OFFERING OF STRONG WINE FOR THE L-RD ON THE HOLY ALTAR IN THE TEMPLE. PREPARE THE SECOND LAMB TO BE OFTERED IN THE LATE AFTERNOON, AND PREPARE THE SAME FLOUR AND WINE OFFERINGS AS IN THE MORNING. IT IS A FIRE-OFFERING, WHICH IS OFFERED TO MAKE A PLEASING SMELL FOR THE L-RD.</h1>
<h1>THE ABOVE-MENTIONED OFFERING SHOULD BE SLAUGHTERED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ALTAR, BEFORE THE L-RD-IN THE COURTYARD OF THE TEMPLE. AFTER THIS IS DONE, THE DESCENDANTS OF AARON-THE KOHANIM-SHOULD SPRINKLE ITS BLOOD AROUND THE ALTAR.</h1>
<h3 class="hint">Ketoret — Incense:</h3>
<h1>YOU ARE THE L-RD, OUR GOD AND THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS, BEFORE WHOM OUR ANCESTORS BURNED THE INCENSE OF SPICES WHEN THE HOLY TEMPLE STOOD, AS YOU COMMANDED THEM THROUGH MOSES, YOUR PROPHET. AS IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR TORAH:</h1>
<h1>THE L-RD SAID TO MOSES: TAKE THE FOLLOWING SPICES FOR YOURSELF: STACTE, ONYCHA, GALBANUM, OTHER SPICES, AND PURE FRANKINCENSE; THE FOUR SPICES NAMED ABOVE SHOULD BE TAKEN IN EQUAL AMOUNTS. MAKE IT INTO INCENSE BY EXPERTLY MIXING THE INGREDIENTS INTO A WELL-BLENDED MIXTURE. THE INCENSE SHOULD STAY PURE AND HOLY-IT SHOULDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING IMPURE OR BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. GRIND SOME OF THE MIXTURE UNTIL IT IS VERY FINE. EVERY DAY, PUT SOME OF IT ON THE INNER ALTAR, WHICH IS BEFORE THE ARK THAT CONTAINS THE TABLETS IN THE SANCTUARY, WHICH IS THE PLACE WHERE I MEET WITH YOU. YOU SHOULD TREAT THIS INCENSE AS A MOST HOLY OFFERING. IT ALSO SAYS IN THE TORAH: AARON SHOULD BURN THE INCENSE ON THE ALTAR; EVERY MORNING HE SHOULD BURN IT WHEN HE CLEANS THE LAMPS OF THE MENORAH. AARON SHOULD ALSO BURN THE INCENSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON, WHEN HE LIGHTS THE LAMPS OF THE MENORAH. THE INCENSE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OFFERED BEFORE THE L-RD, THROUGHOUT ALL OF YOUR GENERATIONS.</h1>
<h1>OUR RABBIS TAUGHT: HOW WAS THE & INCENSE PREPARED? THE INCENSE PREPARED FOR ONE YEAR CONTAINED 368 MANIM. EACH MANEH WEIGHED ABOUT ONE POUND. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, 365 OF THE 368 MANIM WERE USED, EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN A SOLAR YEAR. ONE MANEH WAS USED EACH DAY OF THE YEAR; HALF WAS USED IN THE MORNING, AND THE OTHER HALF WAS USED IN THE AFTERNOON. THIS IS HOW 365 OF THE 368 MANIM WERE USED DURING THE YEAR, LEAVING THREE MANIM LEFT OVER. THE HIGH PRIEST WOULD BRING TWO HANDFULS FROM THESE THREE MANIM INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES ON YOM KIPPUR. ALTHOUGH THESE THREE MANIM WERE ALREADY GROUND, A KOHEN WOULD PUT THEM BACK INTO THE GRINDER ON THE DAY BEFORE YOM KIPPUR, AND GRIND THEM AGAIN VERY THOROUGHLY IN ORDER TO MAKE AN EXTREMELY FINE POWDER. THE INCENSE HAD ELEVEN KINDS OF SPICES IN IT. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1. BALM, 2. ONYCHA, 3. GALBANUM, 4. FRANKINCENSE; EACH OF THESE FOUR SPICES WEIGHED SEVENTY MANEH, 280 MANEH ALTOGETHER; 5. MYRRH, 6. CASSIA, 7. SPIKE-NARD, 8. SAFFRON; EACH OF THESE FOUR SPICES WEIGHED SIXTEEN MANEH, SIXTY-FOUR MANEH ALTOGETHER; 9. TWELVE MANEH OF COSTUS, 10. THREE MANEH OF SWEET-SMELLING BARK, 11. AND NINE MANEH OF CINNAMON. ALTOGETHER, THE SPICES PREPARED FOR ONE YEAR WEIGHED 368 MANEH. BESIDES THESE SPICES, THERE WERE OTHER INGREDIENTS USED IN THE INCENSE. THEY WERE: NINE KABIN (ABOUT 3½ GALLONS) OF LYE FROM KARSHINAH AND THREE SEIN PLUS THREE KABIN (ABOUT 7¾ GALLONS) OF WINE FROM CYPRUS. IF CYPRUS WINE WASN'T AVAILABLE, OLD WHITE WINE WAS BROUGHT AND USED INSTEAD. ALSO, A QUARTER OF A KAV (ABOUT SEVENTEEN OUNCES) OF SALT FROM THE AREA OF SODOM WAS ADDED, AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF AN HERB THAT WOULD CAUSE THE SMOKE OF THE INCENSE TO RISE. RABBI NATTAN THE BABYLONIAN SAYS: A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMBER THAT GREW NEXT TO THE JORDAN RIVER WAS ALSO ADDED. IF THE KOHEN PUT HONEY INTO THE INCENSE, THE INCENSE BECAME INVALID. IT HE LEFT OUT EVEN ONE OF ITS ELEVEN INGREDIENTS, HE WOULD DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY.</h1>
<h1>RABBAN SHIMON BEN GAMLIEL SAYS: THE BALM MENTIONED ABOVE IS SIMPLY THE JUICE THAT DRIPS FROM BALSAM TREES. THE LYE FROM KARSHINAH WAS USED FOR SCRUBBING THE ONYCHA, TO MAKE IT LOOK PLEASANT. WINE OF CYPRUS WAS USED TO SOAK THE ONYCHA, SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE A STRONG SMELL. ALTHOUGH THE WATER FROM RAGLAYIM WOULD BE BETTER THAN CYPRUS WINE FOR MAKING THE ONYCHA SMELL STRONG, WATER FROM RAGLAYIM IS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE HOLY TEMPLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT RESPECTFUL.</h1>
<h1>IT IS TAUGHT: RABBI NATTAN SAYS: WHEN THE KOHEN WAS GRINDING THE INCENSE, HE WOULD SAY, "GRIND IT THIN; GRIND IT THIN!" BECAUSE THE VOICE IS GOOD FOR THE INCENSE. IF ONLY HALF OF THE 368 MANIM OF THE INCENSE WAS GROUND IN THE PROPER PROPORTIONS, IT IS KOSHER, BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD WHETHER OR NOT THE INCENSE IS KOSHER IF ONLY A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE 368 MANIM WAS GROUND. RABBI YEHUDAH SAID: THE GENERAL RULE IS AS FOLLOWS: IF THE KOHEN GROUND AND ADDED EACH INGREDIENT FOR THE INCENSE ACCORDING TO ITS RIGHT PROPORTION, THE INCENSE IS KOSHER, EVEN IF ONLY HALF THE AMOUNT OF EACH INGREDIENT WAS PREPARED. BUT IF HE LEFT OUT EVEN ONE OF ITS ELEVEN INGREDIENTS, HE WOULD DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY.</h1>
<h1>IT IS TAUGHT: BAR KAPARA SAYS: ON YOM KIPPUR, WHEN THE HIGH PRIEST TOOK TWO HANDFULS FROM THE THREE EXTRA MANEH, THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME INCENSE LEFT OVER. ONCE EVERY SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE HANDS OF THE HIGH PRIESTS, THE LEFTOVER INCENSE WOULD ADD UP TO 184 MANIM, WHICH WAS HALF OF A YEAR'S WORTH OF INCENSE. WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE KOHANIM ONLY NEEDED TO MAKE ANOTHER 184 MANIM FOR THAT YEAR'S INCENSE. BAR KAPARA ALSO TAUGHT: IF A FEW DROPS OF HONEY HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE INCENSE, IT WOULD HAVE SMELLED SO NICE THAT NO PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD THEMSELVES BACK FROM THE BEAUTIFUL SMELL. IF SO, WHY DIDN'T THEY PUT HONEY INTO THE INCENSE? BECAUSE THE TORAH SAYS: YOU SHOULD NOT OFFER ANY YEAST OR HONEY AS A FIRE-BURNED OFFERING TO THE L-RD.</h1>

THE L-RD IS FAIR IN ALL HIS WAYS, AND HE IS KIND IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. THE L-RD IS CLOSE TO ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM, AND HE ANSWERS ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM TRUTHFULLY AND HONESTLY. HE FULFILLS THE DESIRES AND NEEDS OF THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; HE HEARS THEIR CRIES FOR HELP, AND HE SAVES THEM.
    THE L-RD WATCHES OVER ALL THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, AND HE WILL DESTROY ALL THE EVIL PEOPLE. MY MOUTH WILL SAY THE PRAISES OF THE L-RD, AND EVERYONE WILL DO THE SAME AND BLESS HIS HOLY NAME FOREVER AND EVER. WE WILL BLESS GOD, NOW AND FOREVER. PRAISE THE L-RD.

    <h3 class="hint">The following Psalm is said from the 1st day of Rosh-Chodesh in the month of Elul up to and including Hoshan Rabbah:</h3>
    <h1>BY DAVID. G-D IS MY LIGHT AND MY DELIVERANCE. WHOM SHALL I FEAR? G-D IS THE STRENGTH OF MY LIFE, WHOM SHALL I DREAD? WHEN EVILDOERS APPROACHED ME TO CONSUME MY FLESH, MY TORMENTORS AND MY ENEMIES, IT IS THEY WHO STUMBLED AND FELL. IF AN ARMED CAMP WOULD BESIEGE ME, MY HEART WOULD NOT FEAR. IF A WAR WOULD ARISE AGAINST ME, I TRUST IN THIS. ONE THING I HAVE ASKED OF G-D, THIS I REQUEST: THAT I DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF G-D ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, SO THAT I MAY BEHOLD THE PLEASANTNESS OF G-D AND VISIT HIS BEIS HAMIKDASH. FOR HE WILL HIDE ME IN HIS SHELTER ON THE DAY OF ADVERSITY. HE WILL CONCEAL ME IN THE HIDDEN REACHES OF HIS TENT AND RAISE ME UP ON A ROCK. MY HEAD WILL THEN BE RAISED ABOVE MY ENEMIES AROUND ME AND I WILL SACRIFICE OFFERINGS OF JUBILATION IN HIS TABERNACLE. I WILL SING AND I WILL MAKE MUSIC TO G-D. HEAR MY VOICE, O G-D, WHEN I CALL. BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND ANSWER ME. ON YOUR BEHALF, MY HEART SAYS: “SEEK MY COUNTENANCE”. I WILL SEEK YOUR COUNTENANCE, O G-D. DO NOT CONCEAL YOUR FACE FROM ME. DO NOT SPURN YOUR SERVANT IN ANGER. YOU HAVE BEEN MY HELP. DO NOT FORSAKE ME NOR ABANDON ME, O G-D OF MY DELIVERANCE. ALTHOUGH MY FATHER AND MOTHER HAVE ABANDONED ME, G-D WILL TAKE ME IN. O G-D, TEACH ME YOUR WAY AND GUIDE ME IN THE PATH OF UPRIGHTNESS, BECAUSE OF MY WATCHFUL ENEMIES. DO NOT SURRENDER ME TO THE WISHES OF MY TORMENTORS, FOR FALSE WITNESSES HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME, ADVOCATING VIOLENCE. HAD I NOT TRUSTED THAT I WOULD YET SEE THE GOODNESS OF G-D IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING. PUT YOUR HOPE IN G-D. BE STRONG, LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE, AND PUT YOUR HOPE IN G-D.</h1>

<h1>IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO PRAISE THE MASTER OF EVERYTHING, TO ASCRIBE GREATNESS TO THE PRIMAL CREATOR FOR NOT MAKING US LIKE THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, NOR CAUSING US TO BE LIKE THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH, FOR HE HAS NOT ENDOWED US WITH A PORTION LIKE THEIRS, NOR MADE OUR LOT LIKE THAT OF THEIR MULTITUDES. FOR THEY PROSTRATE THEMSELVES BEFORE VANITY AND NOTHINGNESS. BUT WE BEND THE KNEE, PROSTRATE OURSELVES, AND GIVE THANKS BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS, THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. FOR HE EXTENDS THE HEAVENS AND ESTABLISHES THE EARTH. THE SEAT OF HIS GLORY IS IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND THE ABODE OF HIS STRENGTH IS IN THE LOFTIEST HEIGHTS. HE IS OUR GOD, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. OUR KING IS TRUE. ASIDE FROM HIM, THERE IS NOTHING. AS IT IS WRITTEN IN HIS TORAH: KNOW THIS DAY AND TAKE UNTO YOUR HEART THAT GOD IS THE L-RD IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND UPON THE EARTH BELOW, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.</h1>

<h1>WE THEREFORE PUT OUR HOPE IN YOU, GOD, OUR L-RD, THAT WE MAY SPEEDILY BEHOLD THE SPLENDOR OF YOUR MIGHT, THAT YOU REMOVE IDOLS FROM THE EARTH, SO THAT THE FALSE DEITIES WILL BE UTTERLY CUT OFF, TO PERFECT THE WORLD UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ALMIGHTY. ALL FLESH WILL INVOKE YOUR NAME, CAUSING ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH TO TURN TO YOU. ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH WILL RECOGNIZE AND KNOW THAT EVERY KNEE SHOULD BEND TO YOU, THAT EVERY TONGUE SHOULD SWEAR BY YOUR NAME. BEFORE YOU, GOD, OUR L-RD, THEY WILL KNEEL AND PROSTRATE THEMSELVES AND GIVE HONOR TO THE GLORY OF YOUR NAME. THEY WILL ALL ACCEPT UPON THEMSELVES THE YOKE OF YOUR KINGDOM. MAY YOU SPEEDILY REIGN OVER THEM FOREVER AND EVER. FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS YOURS AND TO ALL ETERNITY YOU WILL REIGN IN GLORY, AS IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR TORAH: “GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER. AND IT IS SAID: GOD SHALL BE KING OVER THE ENTIRE EARTH. ON THAT DAY, GOD WILL BE ONE, AND HIS NAME, ONE.</h1>
