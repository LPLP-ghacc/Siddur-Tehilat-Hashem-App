    BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON, THERE
    WE SAT AND WEPT AS WE REMEMBERED
    ZION. THERE, UPON THE WILLOWS WE
    HUNG OUR HARPS. FOR THERE OUR CAPTORS
    DEMANDED OF US SONGS, AND THOSE
    WHO SCORNED US—REJOICING, SAYING,
    “SING TO US OF THE SONGS OF ZION.”
    HOW CAN WE SING THE SONG OF THE
    LORD ON ALIEN SOIL? IF I FORGET YOU,
    JERUSALEM, LET MY RIGHT HAND FORGET ITS
    DEXTERITY. LET MY TONGUE CLEAVE TO MY
    PALATE IF I WILL NOT REMEMBER YOU, IF
    I WILL NOT BRING TO MIND JERUSALEM
    DURING MY GREATEST JOY! REMEMBER, O
    LORD, AGAINST THE EDOMITES THE DAY OF
    THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM, WHEN
    THEY SAID, “RAZE IT, RAZE IT TO ITS VERY
    FOUNDATION!” O BABYLON, WHO ARE
    DESTINED TO BE LAID WASTE, HAPPY IS HE
    WHO WILL REPAY YOU IN RETRIBUTION FOR
