<h1>G-D IS MERCIFUL AND FORGIVES OUR SINS; HE DOES NOT DESTORY US BECAUSE OF THEM. MANY TIMES, HE TURNS HIS ANGER AWAY FROM US, AND HE DOES NOT STIR UP ALL OF HIS ANGER. SAVE US, L-RD; MAY THE KING OF THE UNIVERSE ANSWER US ON THE DAY THAT WE CALL OUT TO HIM.</h1>
<h1>THE FOLLOWING IS A SONG THAT WAS SUNG BY THE LEVITES ON THE STEPS OF THE HOLY TEMPLE. NOW IT IS TIME TO BLESS THE L-RD AND THANK HIM FOR GIVING US WHAT WE NEED. ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE L-RD, THE ONES WHO STAND UP AND GO TO SYNAGOGUE-THE L-RD'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, SHOULD BLESS G-D. LIFT UP YOUR HANDS IN HOLINESS TO G-D AND BLESS THE L-RD. WHEN YOU BLESS HIM, THE L-RD WILL BLESS YOU FROM ZION (JERUSALEM). G-D, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND EARTH, WILL BLESS US. THE DAYS OF THE REDEMPTION ARE ABOUT TO ARRIVE. THE L-RD WILL COMMAND HIS KINDNESS TO SAVE US FROM EXILE. DURING THE NIGHT-DURING EXILE-HIS SONG OF PRAISE IS WITH ME; I SING SONGS OF PRAISE TO G-D FOR HELPING US IN EXILE. PRAY TO THE G-D WHO GIVES ME LITE. THE SALVATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS COMES FROM THE L-RD; HE IS THEIR STRENGTH AT THE TIME OF THEIR SUFFERING. THE L-RD ALWAYS HELPS THEM AND RESCUES THEM. HE RESCUES THEM FROM WICKED PEOPLE AND SAVES THEM, BECAUSE THEY TRUST AND BELIEVE IN HIM.</h1>

<h3>This phrase is repeated three times:</h3>
<h1>THE L-RD, THE G-D OF ALL CREATIONS, IS ALWAYS WITH US. THE G-D OF JACOB IS OUR STRONGHOLD; HE WILL GIVE US STRENGTH FOREVER.</h1>
<h3>This phrase is repeated three times:</h3>
<h1>FORTUNATE IS THE PERSON WHO TRUSTS IN YOU, L-RD, G-D OF ALL CREATIONS.</h1>
<h3>This phrase is repeated three times:</h3>

<h3>From this point until after the Amida, it is forbidden to say anything other than words of prayer.</h3>
<h3>Chazan:</h3>
<h1 style="font-size: 35px;">LET US NOW BLESS THE L-RD, WHO IS BLESSED!</h1>
<h3>The congregation and chazan say the following, bowing at “Blessed” and standing upright at “L-RD”:</h3>
<h1 style="font-size: 35px;">BLESSED IS THE L-RD, WHO IS BLESSED, FOREVER AND EVER!</h1>
<h3>May be seated.</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, OUR G-D, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO, BY HIS WORD CAUSES THE EVENINGS TO BECOME DARK. WITH WISDOM, HE OPENS THE GATES OF HEAVEN TO LET THE SUN AND MOON SHINE. WITH UNDERSTANDING, HE CHANGES THE TIMES WHEN IT BECOMES LIGHT AND DARK, AND HE MAKES DIFFERENT TIMES FOR HOT WEATHER AND COLD WEATHER. HE ARRANGES THE STARS IN THEIR PROPER POSITIONS IN THE SKY, ACCORDING TO HIS WILL. G-D CREATES DAY AND NIGHT. HE ROLLS AWAY THE LIGHT BEFORE IT BECOMES DARK AND ROLLS AWAY THE DARKNESS BEFORE IT BECOMES LIGHT. HE CAUSES THE DAY TO PASS AND THEN BRINGS THE NIGHT. HE MAKES A SEPARATION BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT. G-D'S NAME IS "G-D OF ALL CREATIONS." BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, WHO MAKES THE EVENINGS DARK.</h1>
<h1>YOU HAVE LOVED YOUR NATION, THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, WITH AN EVERLASTING LOVE. YOU HAVE TAUGHT US THE TORAH AND ITS COMMANDMENTS. SOME COMMANDMENTS ARE DECREES-WE DO NOT KNOW THEIR REASONS. OTHERS ARE LAWS-WE KNOW THEIR REASONS. THEREFORE, L-RD, OUR G-D, WHEN WE LIE DOWN AND WHEN WE GET UP, WE WILL ALWAYS BE SPEAKING ABOUT YOUR DECREES, AND WE WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE WORDS OF YOUR TORAH AND WITH YOUR COMMANDMENTS FOREVER AND EVER, BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR TRUE LIFE AND THE LENGTH OF OUR DAYS; THEY GIVE US LONG LIFE. WE WILL ALWAYS STUDY THEM, BY DAY AND BY NIGHT. G-D, MAY YOUR LOVE NEVER LEAVE US. BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, WHO LOVES THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, HIS NATION.</h1>
<h3>The Chazan says the concluding words of the following blessing above quietly; Do not answer “Amen”.</h3>

<div id="section1" class="section"><h2>{{shema}}</h2></div>
<h3>When saying the Shema, concentrate intently on its meaning. While saying the opening line (שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל), keep in mind that you are accepting G-D's sovereignty; while saying the first paragraph (וְאָהַבְתָּ), keep in mind that you are accepting the commandment to love G-D; and while saying the second paragraph (וְהָיָה), keep in mind that you are accepting all of G-D's commandments. By saying the third paragraph (וַיּאמֶר) you are fulfilling the commandment of remembering the Exodus from Egypt.</h3>
<h3>Special care must be taken to say each word of the Shema clearly. Pause at each punctuation mark to ensure that you do not string the words together and alter their meaning.</h3>
<h3>Say the following verse aloud, covering your eyes with your right hand.</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:50px;">HEAR, O ISRAEL, THE L-RD IS OUR G-D. THE L-RD IS ONE!</h1>
<h3>Say the following line quietly:</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:35px;">THE NAME OF G-D'S GLORIOUS KINGDOM IS BLESSED FOREVER AND EVER.</h1>
<h1>YOU SHALL LOVE THE L-RD YOUR G-D WITH ALL YOUR HEART, WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT. AND THESE WORDS WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY SHALL BE UPON YOUR HEART. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM THOROUGHLY TO YOUR CHILDREN, AND YOU SHALL SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. YOU SHALL BIND THEM AS A SIGN UPON YOUR HAND, AND THEY SHALL BE FOR A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES. AND YOU SHALL WRITE THEM UPON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND UPON YOUR GATES.</h1>
<h1>
    AND IT WILL BE, IF YOU WILL DILIGENTLY OBEY MY COMMANDMENTS WHICH I ENJOIN UPON YOU THIS DAY, TO LOVE THE L-RD YOUR G-D AND TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, I WILL GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND AT THE PROPER TIME, THE EARLY RAIN AND THE LATE RAIN, AND YOU WILL GATHER IN YOUR GRAIN, YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL. AND I WILL GIVE GRASS IN YOUR FIELDS FOR YOUR CATTLE, AND YOU WILL EAT AND BE SATED. TAKE CARE LEST YOUR HEART BE LURED AWAY, AND YOU TURN ASTRAY AND WORSHIP ALIEN G-DS AND BOW DOWN TO THEM. FOR THEN THE L-RD'S WRATH WILL FLARE UP AGAINST YOU, AND HE WILL CLOSE THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO RAIN AND THE EARTH WILL NOT YIELD ITS PRODUCE, AND YOU WILL SWIFTLY PERISH FROM THE GOOD LAND WHICH THE L-RD GIVES YOU. THEREFORE, PLACE THESE WORDS OF MINE UPON YOUR HEART AND UPON YOUR SOUL, AND BIND THEM FOR A SIGN ON YOUR HAND, AND THEY SHALL BE FOR A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN, TO SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. AND YOU SHALL INSCRIBE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND ON YOUR GATES - SO THAT YOUR DAYS AND THE DAYS OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE PROLONGED ON THE LAND WHICH THE L-RD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE TO THEM FOR AS LONG AS THE HEAVENS ARE ABOVE THE EARTH.
</h1>
<h1>THE L-RD SPOKE TO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND TELL THEM TO MAKE FOR THEMSELVES FRINGES ON THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS, AND TO ATTACH A THREAD OF BLUE ON THE FRINGE OF EACH CORNER. THEY SHALL BE TO YOU AS TZIZIT, AND YOU SHALL LOOK UPON THEM AND REMEMBER ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE L-RD AND FULFILL THEM, AND YOU WILL NOT FOLLOW AFTER YOUR HEART AND AFTER YOUR EYES BY WHICH YOU GO ASTRAY - SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND FULFILL ALL MY COMMANDMENTS AND BE HOLY TO YOUR G-D. I AM THE L-RD YOUR G-D WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO BE YOUR G-D; I, THE L-RD, AM YOUR G-D. TRULY.</h1>
<h3>Do not pause between the words (אֲנִי יְהֹוָה אֱלהֵיכֶם) and (אֱמֶת). The chazan says (אֲנִי יְהֹוָה אֱלהֵיכֶם: אֱמֶת) quietly, and then repeats aloud (יְהֹוָה אֱלהֵיכֶם: אֱמֶת). When praying without a minyan, repeat the words (אֲנִי יְהֹוָה אֱלהֵיכֶם) 2 times, before concluding with (אֱמֶת).</h3>
<h1>WE BELIEVE ALL THIS THAT WAS SAID IN THE SHEMA, AND IT IS TRUE. TO US, IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT HE IS THE L-RD, OUR G-D, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES HIM, AND WE, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, ARE HIS PEOPLE. G-D SAVES US FROM THE HAND OF KINGS WHO TRY TO HARM US; IT IS OUR KING WHO REDEEMS US FROM THE HAND OF ALL THE CRUEL RULERS WHO SEEK TO HARM US. HE IS THE G-D WHO TAKES RETRIBUTION FROM OUR ENEMIES FOR US. HE PAYS BACK ALL OUR ENEMIES WHO TRY TO DESTROY OUR SOULS; HE PUNISHES THEM. HE DOES AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF GREAT THINGS AND PERFORMS WONDERS, UNTIL THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THEY CANNOT BE COUNTED. HE KEPT US ALIVE WHEN OUR ENEMIES TRIED TO KILL US, AND HE DID NOT LET OUR FEET SLIP WHEN OUR ENEMIES ATTACKED US. HE LED US TO THE HIGH PLACES THAT OUR ENEMIES ONCE RULED, AND HE INCREASED OUR STRENGTH OVER ALL OUR ENEMIES. HE IS THE G-D WHO TOOK RETRIBUTION FROM PHARAOH FOR WHAT HE DID TO US IN EGYPT; HE DID WONDERS AND MIRACLES FOR US IN THE LAND OF THE EGYPTIANS, WHO WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF NOAH'S SON HAM. G-D ANGRILY STRUCK AND KILLED ALL THE FIRSTBORN EGYPTIANS, HE TOOK OUT HIS PEOPLE, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, FROM AMONG THEM, AND BROUGHT THEM TO AN EVERLASTING FREEDOM. G-D LED HIS CHILDREN THROUGH THE TWELVE DIVIDED PARTS OF THE SEA OF REEDS, AND THOSE WHO WERE CHASING THEM, AND THEIR ENEMIES, G-D DROWNED IN THE DEEP SEA. WHEN G-D'S CHILDREN, THE JEWISH NATION, SAW HIS STRENGTH, THEY PRAISED AND GAVE THANKS TO HIS NAME, AND THEY WILLINGLY ACCEPTED HIM AS KING OVER THEM. MOSES AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH GREAT JOY RAISED THEIR VOICES IN SONG TO YOU, AND THEY ALL SAID:</h1>
<h1>WHO FROM AMONG ALL THE GREAT AND POWERFUL CREATIONS IS LIKE YOU, L-RD? WHO IS LIKE YOU, G-D? YOU ARE ADORNED WITH HOLINESS. THE WONDERS THAT YOU DO ARE SO AWESOME THAT THEY CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY PRAISED. YOUR CHILDREN, THE JEWISH NATION, SAW YOUR RULERSHIP WHEN YOU SPLIT THE SEA OF REEDS IN FRONT OF MOSES AND THE ENTIRE NATION. THEY ANNOUNCED PROUDLY, "THIS IS MY G-D!" AND SAID "THE L-RD WILL RULE AS KING FOREVER AND EVER." IT SAYS IN JEREMIAH: THE L-RD HAS REDEEMED THE JEWISH NATION, THE CHILDREN OF JACOB, AND HE HAS SAVED THEM FROM THEIR ENEMIES, WHOSE HAND IS STRONGER THAN THEIRS. BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, THE REDEEMER OF ISRAEL.</h1>
<h1>G-D, OUR FATHER, LET US LIE DOWN AT NIGHT IN PEACE. OUR KING, LET US STAND UP IN THE MORNING TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE AND HAVE PEACE. MAKE US BETTER PEOPLE BY SHARING YOUR GOOD ADVICE WITH US. SAVE US QUICKLY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR NAME, SO THAT IT WILL BE HONORED AMONGST THE NATIONS, AND SPREAD THE COVERING OF YOUR PEACE OVER US. PROTECT US AND REMOVE ANY ENEMY, PLAGUE, DEATH BY SWORD, HUNGER, AND SADNESS FROM US. GET RID OF THE SATAN, WHO STANDS IN FRONT OF US TO STOP US FROM SERVING G-D, AND WHO STANDS BEHIND US TO PULL US AWAY FROM G-D. PROTECT US FROM TROUBLE BY SHELTERING US IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS, AND GUARD US DURING OUR TRAVELS, WHEN WE GO OUT AND WHEN WE COME BACK. DO THIS SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE GOOD AND PEACEFUL LIVES, NOW AND FOREVER, BECAUSE YOU, G-D, ARE THE ONE WHO GUARDS US AND RESCUES US. BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, WHO GUARDS HIS NATION, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, FOREVER.</h1>

<h3>The chazan says half kaddish:</h3>
<h1>MAY G-D'S GREAT NAME BE EXALTED AND HOLY (AMEN)
    THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE, WHICH HE CREATED AS HE WANTED. MAY HE ESTABLISH HIS KINGDOM OVER THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, BRING HIS REDEMPTION, AND SPEED UP THE COMING OF HIS MASHIACH, (AMEN)

While still bowing, he should turn his head to his left saying, "He who makes peace in His heavens"; bow forward, saying, "may He"; turn his head to his right, saying, "make peace for us"; and finally bow forward, saying, "and for all Israel; and say, Amen".</h3>
<h3>During the Ten Days of Repentance instead of “PEACE”, say “THE PEACE”.</h3>
<h1>HE WHO MAKES PEACE IN HIS HEAVENS, MAY HE MAKE PEACE FOR US AND FOR ALL ISRAEL; AND SAY, AMEN.</h1>
<h1>MAY IT BE YOUR WILL, L-RD OUR G‑D AND G‑D OF OUR FATHERS, THAT THE BET HAMIKDASH BE SPEEDILY REBUILT IN OUR DAYS, AND GRANT US OUR PORTION IN YOUR TORAH.</h1>
