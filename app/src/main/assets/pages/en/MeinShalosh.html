<h3 class="hint">"Al Hamichyah" is said after eating foods (not bread) prepared from the five grains. Anything that gets the fore-blessing "Mezonot" gets the after-blessing "Al Hamichyah."
    "Al Hagefen" is recited after drinking wine or grape juice.
    "Al Haaretz v'al Hapeirot" is for the special fruits with which the Land of Israel was blessed: grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates.
    If one partook of any combination of the above, their blessings should be combined, by adding the words in parentheses.
