<h3>Havdala is said at the conclusion of Shabbat and festivals (even when the festival is followed by Chol Hamoed). When a festival occurs on Saturday night, Avdala is said during the festival Kiddush.</h3>
<h3>When making Havdala following a festival that occurs on a weekday, the blessings on the spices and the flame are not said.</h3>
<h3>The cup is filled until it overflows, in order to begin the week with a symbol of God's overflowing blessings.</h3>
<h3>Stand and hold the cup in the right hand while reciting Havdala. Those listening should respond Amen.</h3>
<h1>
    INDEED, GOD IS MY SALVATION. I AM CONFIDENT AND I WILL NOT BE AFRAID, BECAUSE THE LORD GOD HAS SAVED ME TO SHOW HIS MIGHT AND SO THAT I SHALL PRAISE HIM, AND HE HAS BEEN MY SALVATION. GOD'S HELP WILL BE AS PLENTIFUL AS WATER FLOWING FROM A SPRING, AND YOU WILL JOYFULLY DRAW WATER FROM THE SPRINGS OF SALVATION. THE POWER OF SALVATION BELONGS TO THE LORD. GOD, MAY YOUR BLESSING BE UPON YOUR PEOPLE FOREVER. THE LORD, THE GOD OF ALL CREATIONS, IS ALWAYS WITH US. THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR STRONGHOLD; HE WILL GIVE US STRENGTH FOREVER.
    LORD, GOD OF ALL CREATIONS, FORTUNATE IS THE PERSON WHO TRUSTS IN YOU. SAVE US, LORD; MAY THE KING OF THE UNIVERSE ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL OUT TO HIM.
</h1>
<h3>All those listening to Havdalah say the following verse aloud, followed by the leader:</h3>
<h1>FOR THE JEWS THERE WAS LIGHT, HAPPINESS, JOY, AND HONOR. SO LET IT BE WITH US.</h1>
<h1>I WILL RAISE THE CUP OF SALVATION AND CALL OUT IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.</h1>

<h1>ATTENTION, GENTLEMEN!</h1>

<h3>Blessing on wine:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES THE FRUIT OF THE VINE. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Hold the spices in your right hand while saying the following blessing:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPICES. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Smell the spices.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Blessing on fire:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES THE DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS OF FIRE. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Raise your fingernails toward the light of the flame and look at them.</h3>
<h3>Hold the cup again, and continue:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO SEPARATES BETWEEN THAT WHICH IS HOLY AND THAT WHICH IS ORDINARY, BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS, BETWEEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND OTHER NATIONS, AND BETWEEN THE SEVENTH DAY AND THE SIX WORK DAYS. BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, WHO SEPARATES BETWEEN THAT WHICH IS HOLY AND THAT WHICH IS ORDINARY. (AMEN)</h1>

<h3>After the above blessing, drink at least 3.5 oz. from the cup. Extinguish the flame with the remaining wine to show that the flame was lit for no purpose other than Havdalah.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Say the appropriate after-blessing after drinking the wine:</h3>
