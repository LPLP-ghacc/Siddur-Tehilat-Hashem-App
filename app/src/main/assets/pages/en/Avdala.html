<h3>Havdala is said at the conclusion of Shabbat and festivals (even when the festival is followed by Chol Hamoed). When a festival occurs on Saturday night, Avdala is said during the festival Kiddush.</h3>
<h3>When making Havdala following a festival that occurs on a weekday, the blessings on the spices and the flame are not said.</h3>
<h3>The cup is filled until it overflows, in order to begin the week with a symbol of G-D's overflowing blessings.</h3>
<h3>Stand and hold the cup in the right hand while reciting Havdala. Those listening should respond Amen.</h3>
<h1>
    INDEED, G-D IS MY SALVATION. I AM CONFIDENT AND I WILL NOT BE AFRAID, BECAUSE THE L-RD G-D HAS SAVED ME TO SHOW HIS MIGHT AND SO THAT I SHALL PRAISE HIM, AND HE HAS BEEN MY SALVATION. G-D'S HELP WILL BE AS PLENTIFUL AS WATER FLOWING FROM A SPRING, AND YOU WILL JOYFULLY DRAW WATER FROM THE SPRINGS OF SALVATION. THE POWER OF SALVATION BELONGS TO THE L-RD. G-D, MAY YOUR BLESSING BE UPON YOUR PEOPLE FOREVER. THE L-RD, THE G-D OF ALL CREATIONS, IS ALWAYS WITH US. THE G-D OF JACOB IS OUR STRONGHOLD; HE WILL GIVE US STRENGTH FOREVER.
    L-RD, G-D OF ALL CREATIONS, FORTUNATE IS THE PERSON WHO TRUSTS IN YOU. SAVE US, L-RD; MAY THE KING OF THE UNIVERSE ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL OUT TO HIM.
</h1>
<h3>All those listening to Havdalah say the following verse aloud, followed by the leader:</h3>
<h1>FOR THE JEWS THERE WAS LIGHT, HAPPINESS, JOY, AND HONOR. SO LET IT BE WITH US.</h1>
<h1>I WILL RAISE THE CUP OF SALVATION AND CALL OUT IN THE NAME OF THE L-RD.</h1>

<h1>ATTENTION, GENTLEMEN!</h1>

<h3>Blessing on wine:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, OUR G-D, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES THE FRUIT OF THE VINE. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Hold the spices in your right hand while saying the following blessing:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, OUR G-D, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPICES. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Smell the spices.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Blessing on fire:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, OUR G-D, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO CREATES THE DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS OF FIRE. (AMEN)</h1>
<h3>Raise your fingernails toward the light of the flame and look at them.</h3>
<h3>Hold the cup again, and continue:</h3>
<h1>BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, OUR G-D, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, WHO SEPARATES BETWEEN THAT WHICH IS HOLY AND THAT WHICH IS ORDINARY, BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS, BETWEEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND OTHER NATIONS, AND BETWEEN THE SEVENTH DAY AND THE SIX WORK DAYS. BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, WHO SEPARATES BETWEEN THAT WHICH IS HOLY AND THAT WHICH IS ORDINARY. (AMEN)</h1>

<h3>After the above blessing, drink at least 3.5 oz. from the cup. Extinguish the flame with the remaining wine to show that the flame was lit for no purpose other than Havdalah.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Say the appropriate after-blessing after drinking the wine:</h3>

<br>
<h3>
    After Havdalah, the following is said. It is customary to say it with another person
    from one Siddur.
</h3>
<h3>When Chol Hamoed occurs on Saturday night, the following is recited quietly:</h3>
<h1>
    MAY G-D GIVE YOU OF THE DEW OF HEAVEN, OF THE FAT OF
    THE EARTH, AND AN ABUNDANCE OF GRAIN AND WINE. PEOPLES SHALL
    SERVE YOU AND NATIONS BOW DOWN TO YOU; BE MASTER OVER YOUR
    BROTHERS, AND YOUR MOTHER’S SONS SHALL BOW DOWN TO YOU.
    THOSE WHO CURSE YOU SHALL BE CURSED, AND THOSE WHO BLESS
    YOU, BLESSED. AND MAY G-D, THE OMNIPOTENT, BLESS YOU AND
    MAKE YOU FRUITFUL AND NUMEROUS, SO THAT YOU MAY BECOME
    AN ASSEMBLY OF PEOPLES. MAY HE BESTOW UPON YOU THE
    BLESSING OF ABRAHAM, UPON YOU AND UPON YOUR PROGENY WITH
    YOU, THAT YOU MAY INHERIT THE LAND WHERE YOU DWELL, WHICH
    G-D HAD GIVEN TO ABRAHAM. IT IS FROM THE G-D OF YOUR
    FATHER WHO WILL HELP YOU, FROM THE OMNIPOTENT ONE WHO
    WILL BLESS YOU WITH BLESSINGS OF HEAVEN ABOVE, WITH BLESSINGS
    OF THE DEEP THAT COUCHES BELOW, WITH BLESSINGS OF BREAST AND
    WOMB. THE BLESSINGS BESTOWED BY G-D UPON YOUR FATHER
    HAVE SURPASSED THE BLESSINGS BESTOWED UPON MY PARENTS TO
    THE UTMOST BOUNDS OF THE ETERNAL HILLS—MAY THEY BE UPON
    THE HEAD OF JOSEPH, UPON THE HEAD OF HIM WHO WAS SEPARATED
    FROM HIS BROTHERS. HE WILL LOVE YOU AND BLESS YOU AND
    MULTIPLY YOU; HE WILL BLESS THE FRUIT OF YOUR WOMB AND THE
    FRUIT OF YOUR LAND, YOUR GRAIN, YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL, THE
    OFFSPRING OF YOUR CATTLE AND THE FLOCKS OF YOUR SHEEP, ON THE
    LAND WHICH HE SWORE TO YOUR ANCESTORS TO GIVE TO YOU. YOU
    SHALL BE BLESSED MORE THAN ALL THE NATIONS; THERE SHALL BE NO
    BARREN MALE OR FEMALE AMONG YOU OR AMONG YOUR CATTLE. THE
    L-RD WILL REMOVE FROM YOU ALL ILLNESS; NONE OF THE SEVERE
    MALADIES OF EGYPT WHICH YOU KNEW WILL HE BRING UPON YOU,
    RATHER HE WILL INFLICT THEM UPON ALL YOUR ENEMIES.
</h1>

<h1>
    MAY THE ANGEL WHO HAS DELIVERED ME FROM ALL EVIL
    BLESS THE LADS, AND MAY MY NAME AND THE NAME OF MY
    FATHERS ABRAHAM AND ISAAC BE CALLED UPON THEM, AND MAY
    THEY INCREASE ABUNDANTLY LIKE FISH IN THE MIDST OF THE
    EARTH. THE L-RD YOUR G-D HAS MULTIPLIED YOU, AND YOU
    ARE TODAY AS NUMEROUS AS THE STARS IN THE SKY. MAY THE
    L-RD, G-D OF YOUR FATHERS, MAKE YOU A THOUSAND TIMES
    MORE NUMEROUS THAN YOU ARE, AND BLESS YOU AS HE
    PROMISED YOU.
</h1>

<h1>
    BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN THE CITY, AND BLESSED SHALL
    YOU BE IN THE FIELD. BLESSED SHALL BE YOUR BASKET AND YOUR
    KNEADING-BOWL. BLESSED SHALL BE THE FRUIT OF YOUR WOMB
    AND THE FRUIT OF YOUR LAND, THE FRUIT OF YOUR LIVESTOCK, THE
    INCREASE OF YOUR CATTLE AND THE OFFSPRING OF YOUR SHEEP.
    BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN YOUR COMING, AND BLESSED SHALL YOU
    BE IN YOUR GOING. THE L-RD WILL COMMAND THE BLESSING TO
    BE WITH YOU IN YOUR STOREHOUSES AND IN ALL THINGS TO WHICH
    YOU PUT YOUR HAND, AND HE WILL BLESS YOU IN THE LAND
    WHICH THE L-RD YOUR G-D GIVES TO YOU. THE L-RD WILL OPEN
    FOR YOU HIS GOOD TREASURE, THE HEAVENS, TO GIVE RAIN FOR
    YOUR LAND AT ITS PROPER TIME, AND TO BLESS ALL THE WORKS OF
    YOUR HANDS; YOU WILL LEND TO MANY NATIONS BUT YOU WILL
    NOT BORROW. FOR THE L-RD YOUR G-D HAS BLESSED YOU AS
    HE HAS PROMISED YOU; YOU WILL MAKE LOANS TO MANY
    NATIONS BUT YOU WILL NOT REQUIRE LOANS; YOU WILL DOMINATE
    MANY NATIONS, BUT THEY WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU. FORTUNATE
    ARE YOU, ISRAEL! WHO IS LIKE YOU, A PEOPLE DELIVERED BY THE
    L-RD, YOUR HELPING SHIELD AND THE SWORD OF YOUR GLORY;
    YOUR ENEMIES WILL DENY THEIR IDENTITY BEFORE YOU, AND YOU
    SHALL TREAD UPON THEIR HIGH PLACES.
</h1>

<h1>
    ISRAEL WILL BE DELIVERED BY THE L-RD WITH AN EVERLASTING DELIVERANCE; YOU WILL NOT BE DISGRACED NOR HUMILIATED FOREVER AND EVER. YOU WILL EAT AND BE SATIATED AND PRAISE THE NAME OF THE L-RD YOUR G-D WHO HAS DEALT WITH YOU WONDROUSLY; AND MY PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE PUT TO SHAME. AND YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM WITHIN THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, THAT I AM THE L-RD YOUR G-D, AND THERE IS NONE ELSE; AND MY PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE PUT TO SHAME. FOR YOU WILL GO OUT WITH JOY, AND BE LED FORTH IN PEACE; THE MOUNTAINS AND THE HILLS WILL BURST INTO SONG BEFORE YOU, AND ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD WILL CLAP HANDS. INDEED, G-D IS MY DELIVERANCE; I AM CONFIDENT AND SHALL NOT FEAR, FOR G-D THE L-RD IS MY STRENGTH AND SONG, AND HE HAS BEEN A HELP TO ME. YOU SHALL DRAW WATER WITH JOY FROM THE WELLSPRINGS OF DELIVERANCE. AND YOU WILL SAY ON THAT DAY, “OFFER THANKS TO THE L-RD, PROCLAIM HIS NAME, MAKE HIS DEEDS KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS; CAUSE IT TO BE REMEMBERED THAT HIS NAME IS EXALTED. SING TO THE L-RD FOR HE HAS DONE GREAT THINGS; THIS IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE EARTH. RAISE YOUR VOICE JOYOUSLY AND SING, YOU DWELLER IN ZION, FOR THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL IS GREAT IN YOUR MIDST.” ON THAT DAY ISRAEL WILL SAY, “INDEED, THIS IS OUR G-D IN WHOM WE HAVE HOPED THAT HE SHOULD DELIVER US; THIS IS THE L-RD IN WHOM WE HAVE HOPED; LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE IN HIS DELIVERANCE.”
</h1>

<h1>
    THE L-RD, CREATOR OF THE SPEECH OF THE LIPS, SAYS,
    “PEACE, PEACE TO HIM WHO IS FAR AND TO HIM WHO IS NEAR,
    AND I WILL HEAL HIM.” A FEELING ENFOLDED AMASAI, THE CHIEF
    OF THE CAPTAINS AND HE SAID, “WE ARE YOURS, DAVID, ON
    YOUR SIDE, SON OF YISHAI; PEACE, PEACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE
    TO YOUR HELPERS, FOR YOUR G-D HELPS YOU.” DAVID RECEIVED
    THEM AND PLACED THEM AT THE HEAD OF THE BRIGADE. AND
    YOU SHALL SAY, “MAY IT BE SO THROUGHOUT LIFE! MAY YOU BE
    AT PEACE, AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD AT PEACE, AND ALL THAT IS
    YOURS AT PEACE.” THE L-RD WILL GIVE STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE;
    THE L-RD WILL BLESS HIS PEOPLE WITH PEACE.
