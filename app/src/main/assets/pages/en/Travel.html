<h1>MAY IT BE YOUR WILL, L-RD, OUR G-D AND THE G-D OF OUR FATHERS, THAT YOU SHOULD LEAD US IN PEACE, DIRECT OUR STEPS IN PEACE, GUIDE US IN PEACE, SUPPORT US IN PEACE, AND BRING US TO OUR DESTINATION FOR LIFE, FOR HAPPINESS, AND FOR PEACE.</h1>

<h3 class="hint">If returning the same day:</h3>
<h3>AND RETURN US IN PEACE.</h3>
<h1>RESCUE US FROM THE HANDS OF EVERY ENEMY AND HIDDEN ATTACKER AND ROBBERS AND WILD ANIMALS ALONG THE WAY. SAVE US FROM ANY DISASTER THAT MAY COME AND HARM THE WORLD. SEND BLESSING IN EVERYTHING WE DO. GIVE ME GRACE, KINDNESS, AND MERCY IN YOUR EYES AND THE EYES OF EVERYONE WHO SEES US. GIVE US MUCH KINDNESS. HEAR THE VOICE OF OUR PRAYER, BECAUSE YOU HEAR THE PRAYER BY EVERY MOUTH. BLESSED ARE YOU, L-RD, WHO HEARS PRAYER.
