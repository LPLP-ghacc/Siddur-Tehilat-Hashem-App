<h3 class="hint">In the year when the Tabernacle was first dedicated, on each of the first twelve days of the month of Nissan, a Nassi (Leader) from one of the twelve tribes of Israel brought a special offering. The custom is to say the section of Torah that describes each offering on the day it was offered, followed by an additional prayer. On the thirteenth day of Nissan, an additional section of Torah is said, without the additional prayer.</h3>

    AND IT WAS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE, AND
    HAD ANOINTED IT AND SANCTIFIED IT AND ALL ITS VESSELS, AND THE ALTAR AND ALL ITS VESSELS,
    AND HAD ANOINTED THEM AND SANCTIFIED THEM—THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL, THE HEADS
    OF THEIR FATHER’S HOUSES, WHO WERE THE PRINCES OF THE TRIBES, THOSE WHO HAD
    SUPERINTENDED THE COUNTING, OFFERED: AND THEY BROUGHT THEIR OFFERING BEFORE THE
    LORD—SIX COVERED WAGONS AND TWELVE OXEN, A WAGON FOR EVERY TWO OF THE PRINCES
    AND AN OX FOR EACH ONE; AND THEY PRESENTED THEM BEFORE THE TABERNACLE. AND THE
    LORD SPOKE TO MOSES, SAYING: ACCEPT IT FROM THEM THAT THEY MAY BE USED IN THE
    SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING, AND GIVE THEM TO THE LEVI’IM, TO EACH MAN
    ACCORDING TO HIS SERVICE. MOSES TOOK THE WAGONS AND THE OXEN AND GAVE THEM TO
    THE LEVI’IM. TWO WAGONS AND FOUR OXEN HE GAVE TO THE SONS OF GERSHON,
    ACCORDING TO THEIR SERVICE, AND FOUR WAGONS AND EIGHT OXEN HE GAVE TO THE SONS
    OF MERARI, ACCORDING TO THEIR SERVICE—UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ITAMAR THE SON OF
    AARON THE KOHEN. BUT TO THE SONS OF KEHAT HE DID NOT GIVE ANY, SINCE THEIRS WAS
    THE SERVICE OF CARRYING THE MOST SACRED OBJECTS; THEY SHALL CARRY THEM UPON THEIR
    SHOULDERS. THE PRINCES BROUGHT THE DEDICATION-OFFERING FOR THE ALTAR ON THE DAY
    THAT IT WAS ANOINTED, AND THE PRINCES OFFERED THEIR OFFERING BEFORE THE ALTAR. AND
    THE LORD SAID TO MOSES: THEY SHALL PRESENT THEIR OFFERING, EACH PRINCE ON HIS
    DAY, FOR THE DEDICATION OF THE ALTAR. AND HE WHO PRESENTED HIS OFFERING ON THE
    FIRST DAY WAS NACHSHON THE SON OF AMINADAV OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. AND HIS
    OFFERING WAS: ONE SILVER DISH WHOSE WEIGHT WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SHEKELS, ONE SILVER BOWL OF SEVENTY SHEKELS BY SANCTUARY WEIGHT—BOTH FILLED WITH FINE FLOUR
    MIXED WITH OIL FOR A MEAL-OFFERING; ONE GOLDEN CUP OF TEN SHEKELS, FILLED WITH

    SANCTUARY SHEKELS. TWELVE GOLDEN CUPS, FILLED WITH INCENSE, EACH CUP WEIGHING TEN
    SANCTUARY SHEKELS; ALL THE GOLD OF THE CUPS WAS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY. ALL THE
    OXEN FOR THE BURNT-OFFERING WERE TWELVE BULLOCKS, TWELVE RAMS, TWELVE YEARLING
    LAMBS, AND THEIR MEAL-OFFERING; AND TWELVE GOATS FOR A SIN-OFFERING. AND ALL THE
    OXEN FOR THE SACRIFICE OF PEACE-OFFERINGS WERE TWENTY-FOUR BULLOCKS, SIXTY RAMS,
    SIXTY HE-GOATS, SIXTY YEARLING LAMBS. THIS WAS THE DEDICATION-OFFERING FOR THE ALTAR
    AFTER IT WAS ANOINTED. WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH
    HIM, HE HEARD THE VOICE SPEAKING TO HIM FROM ABOVE THE COVER THAT WAS UPON
    THE ARK OF TESTIMONY, FROM BETWEEN THE TWO KRUVIM; AND HE SPOKE TO HIM. THE
    LORD SPOKE TO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK TO AARON AND SAY TO HIM: WHEN YOU LIGHT
    THE LAMPS, THE SEVEN LAMPS SHALL SHED LIGHT TOWARD THE CENTRAL SHAFT OF THE
    MENORAH. AND AARON DID SO; HE LIT ITS LAMPS TOWARD THE CENTRAL SHAFT OF THE
    MENORAH, AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED MOSES. AND THIS IS HOW THE MENORAH WAS
    MADE: IT WAS HAMMERED GOLD, FROM ITS BASE TO ITS FLOWERS IT WAS HAMMERED OF
    ONE PIECE; ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN THAT THE LORD HAD SHOWN MOSES, SO HE MADE
    THE MENORAH.
