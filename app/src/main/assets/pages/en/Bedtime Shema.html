<div id="section1" class="section"><h2>{{shema}}</h2></div>

<h3>When saying the Shema, concentrate intently on its meaning. While saying the opening line (שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל), keep in mind that you are accepting G-D's sovereignty; while saying the first paragraph (וְאָהַבְתָּ), keep in mind that you are accepting the commandment to love G-D; and while saying the second paragraph (וְהָיָה), keep in mind that you are accepting all of G-D's commandments. By saying the third paragraph (וַיּאמֶר) you are fulfilling the commandment of remembering the Exodus from Egypt.</h3>
<h3>Special care must be taken to say each word of the Shema clearly. Pause at each punctuation mark to ensure that you do not string the words together and alter their meaning.</h3>
<h3>Say the following verse aloud, covering your eyes with your right hand.</h3>

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:50px;">HEAR, O ISRAEL, THE L-RD IS OUR G-D. THE L-RD IS ONE!</h1>
<h3>Say the following line quietly:</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:35px;">THE NAME OF G-D'S GLORIOUS KINGDOM IS BLESSED FOREVER AND EVER.</h1>
<h1>YOU SHALL LOVE THE L-RD YOUR G-D WITH ALL YOUR HEART, WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT. AND THESE WORDS WHICH I COMMAND YOU TODAY SHALL BE UPON YOUR HEART. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM THOROUGHLY TO YOUR CHILDREN, AND YOU SHALL SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. YOU SHALL BIND THEM AS A SIGN UPON YOUR HAND, AND THEY SHALL BE FOR A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES. AND YOU SHALL WRITE THEM UPON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND UPON YOUR GATES.</h1>
<h1>AND IT WILL BE, IF YOU WILL DILIGENTLY OBEY MY COMMANDMENTS WHICH I ENJOIN UPON YOU THIS DAY, TO LOVE THE L-RD YOUR G-D AND TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, I WILL GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND AT THE PROPER TIME, THE EARLY RAIN AND THE LATE RAIN, AND YOU WILL GATHER IN YOUR GRAIN, YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL. AND I WILL GIVE GRASS IN YOUR FIELDS FOR YOUR CATTLE, AND YOU WILL EAT AND BE SATED. TAKE CARE LEST YOUR HEART BE LURED AWAY, AND YOU TURN ASTRAY AND WORSHIP ALIEN G-DS AND BOW DOWN TO THEM. FOR THEN THE L-RD'S WRATH WILL FLARE UP AGAINST YOU, AND HE WILL CLOSE THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO RAIN AND THE EARTH WILL NOT YIELD ITS PRODUCE, AND YOU WILL SWIFTLY PERISH FROM THE GOOD LAND WHICH THE L-RD GIVES YOU. THEREFORE, PLACE THESE WORDS OF MINE UPON YOUR HEART AND UPON YOUR SOUL, AND BIND THEM FOR A SIGN ON YOUR HAND, AND THEY SHALL BE FOR A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN, TO SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. AND YOU SHALL INSCRIBE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND ON YOUR GATES - SO THAT YOUR DAYS AND THE DAYS OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE PROLONGED ON THE LAND WHICH THE L-RD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE TO THEM FOR AS LONG AS THE HEAVENS ARE ABOVE THE EARTH.</h1>
<h1>THE L-RD SPOKE TO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND TELL THEM TO MAKE FOR THEMSELVES FRINGES ON THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS, AND TO ATTACH A THREAD OF BLUE ON THE FRINGE OF EACH CORNER. THEY SHALL BE TO YOU AS TZIZIT, AND YOU SHALL LOOK UPON THEM AND REMEMBER ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE L-RD AND FULFILL THEM, AND YOU WILL NOT FOLLOW AFTER YOUR HEART AND AFTER YOUR EYES BY WHICH YOU GO ASTRAY - SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND FULFILL ALL MY COMMANDMENTS AND BE HOLY TO YOUR G-D. I AM THE L-RD YOUR G-D WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO BE YOUR G-D; I, THE L-RD, AM YOUR G-D. I, THE L-RD, AM YOUR G-D. TRULY.</h1>

<h3>Say the following paragraph three times:</h3>
<h1>
    BEHOLD, AROUND THE BED OF SOLOMON ARE SIXTY MIGHTY
    MEN, OF THE VALIANT OF ISRAEL. ALL ARE ARMED WITH SWORDS,
    TRAINED IN WAR, EACH WITH HIS SWORD UPON HIS THIGH,
    BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF THE NIGHT.
</h1>
<h3>Say the following paragraph three times:</h3>
<h1>
    THE L-RD BLESS YOU AND GUARD YOU. THE L-RD MAKE
    HIS COUNTENANCE SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU.
    THE L-RD TURN HIS COUNTENANCE TOWARD YOU AND GRANT
    YOU PEACE.
</h1>
<h1>
    YOU WHO DWELLS IN THE SHELTER OF THE MOST HIGH, WHO ABIDES
    IN THE SHADOW OF THE OMNIPOTENT, I SAY TO YOU OF THE L-RD WHO
    IS MY REFUGE AND MY STRONGHOLD, MY G-D IN WHOM I TRUST, THAT
    HE WILL SAVE YOU FROM THE ENSNARING TRAP, FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE
    PESTILENCE. HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS, AND YOU WILL FIND REFUGE UNDER HIS WINGS; HIS TRUTH IS A SHIELD AND AN ARMOR. YOU
    WILL NOT FEAR THE TERROR OF THE NIGHT, NOR THE ARROW THAT FLIES BY
    DAY; THE PESTILENCE THAT PROWLS IN THE DARKNESS, NOR THE DESTRUCTION
    THAT RAVAGES AT NOON. A THOUSAND MAY FALL AT YOUR LEFT SIDE,
    AND TEN THOUSAND AT YOUR RIGHT, BUT IT SHALL NOT REACH YOU. YOU
    NEED ONLY LOOK WITH YOUR EYES, AND YOU WILL SEE THE RETRIBUTION OF
    THE WICKED. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID, “THE L-RD IS MY SHELTER,”
    AND YOU HAVE MADE THE MOST HIGH YOUR HAVEN.

    FOR THE CHOIRMASTER, A PSALM BY DAVID, WHEN NATHAN THE
    PROPHET CAME TO HIM AFTER HE HAD GONE TO BATHSHEBA. BE GRACIOUS TO ME,
    O G-D, IN KEEPING WITH YOUR KINDNESS; IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR
    ABOUNDING COMPASSION, ERASE MY TRANSGRESSIONS. CLEANSE ME THOROUGHLY
    OF MY WRONGDOING, AND PURIFY ME OF MY SIN. FOR I ACKNOWLEDGE MY
    TRANSGRESSIONS, AND MY SIN IS ALWAYS BEFORE ME. AGAINST YOU ALONE HAVE
    I SINNED, AND DONE THAT WHICH IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES; FORGIVE ME SO THAT
    YOU WILL BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR VERDICT, VINDICATED IN YOUR JUDGMENT.
    INDEED, I WAS BEGOTTEN IN SIN, AND IN SIN DID MY MOTHER CONCEIVE ME.
    INDEED, YOU DESIRE TRUTH IN THE INNERMOST PARTS; TEACH ME THE WISDOM
    OF CONCEALED THINGS. PURGE ME WITH HYSSOP AND I SHALL BE PURE; CLEANSE
    ME AND I SHALL BE WHITER THAN SNOW. LET ME HEAR TIDINGS OF JOY AND
    GLADNESS; THEN THE BONES WHICH YOU HAVE SHATTERED WILL REJOICE. HIDE
    YOUR FACE FROM MY SINS, AND ERASE ALL MY TRESPASSES. CREATE IN ME A PURE
    HEART, O G-D, AND RENEW WITHIN ME AN UPRIGHT SPIRIT. DO NOT CAST ME
    OUT OF YOUR PRESENCE, AND DO NOT TAKE YOUR SPIRIT OF HOLINESS AWAY FROM
    ME. RESTORE TO ME THE JOY OF YOUR DELIVERANCE, AND UPHOLD ME WITH A
    SPIRIT OF MAGNANIMITY. I WILL TEACH TRANSGRESSORS YOUR WAYS, AND SINNERS
    WILL RETURN TO YOU. SAVE ME FROM BLOODGUILT, O G-D, G-D OF MY
    DELIVERANCE; MY TONGUE WILL SING YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. MY L-RD, OPEN MY
    LIPS, AND MY MOUTH SHALL DECLARE YOUR PRAISE. FOR YOU DO NOT DESIRE THAT
    I BRING SACRIFICES, NOR DO YOU WISH BURNT OFFERINGS. THE OFFERING
    DESIRABLE TO G-D IS A CONTRITE SPIRIT; A CONTRITE AND BROKEN HEART, G-D,
    YOU DO NOT DISDAIN. IN YOUR GOODWILL, BESTOW GOODNESS UPON ZION;
    REBUILD THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM. THEN WILL YOU DESIRE SACRIFICES OFFERED
    IN RIGHTEOUSNESS, OLAH AND BURNT OFFERINGS; THEN THEY WILL OFFER BULLOCKS
    UPON YOUR ALTAR.
