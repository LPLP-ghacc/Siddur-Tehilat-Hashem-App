<h3 class=”hint”>Unfold the talit and open it wide, kiss it's upper edge, and swing it around from the position in which it is held in front of you until it is hanging behind your back. At this point, begin the blessing.

<h1>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE EVENTS THAT G-D TESTED AVRAHAM. HE SAID TO HIM, “AVRAHAM,” AND HE REPLIED, “HERE I AM.” AND HE SAID, “PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY ONE, WHOM YOU LOVE, YITZCHAK, AND MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE LAND OF MORIAH, AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A SACRIFICE ON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS THAT I WILL DESIGNATE TO YOU.” AVRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND HARNESSED HIS DONKEY. HE TOOK HIS TWO YOUNG MEN WITH HIM, AND YITZCHAK, HIS SON. HE CHOPPED THE WOOD FOR THE OFFERING AND AROSE AND WENT TOWARD THE PLACE OF WHICH G-D HAD TOLD HIM. ON THE THIRD DAY, AVRAHAM LOOKED UP AND SAW THE PLACE FROM AFAR. AVRAHAM SAID TO HIS YOUNG MEN: “STAY HERE WITH THE DONKEY, AND I AND THE YOUTH WILL GO TO THAT PLACE. WE WILL PROSTRATE OURSELVES AND RETURN TO YOU.” AVRAHAM TOOK THE WOOD FOR THE OFFERING AND PLACED IT ON HIS SON, YITZCHAK. IN HIS OWN HAND HE TOOK THE FIRE AND THE SLAUGHTERING KNIFE, AND THE TWO OF THEM WALKED TOGETHER. YITZCHAK SPOKE TO AVRAHAM HIS FATHER, SAYING, “FATHER.” HE ANSWERED, “HERE I AM, MY SON.” HE ASKED, “HERE IS THE FIRE AND THE WOOD, BUT WHERE IS THE LAMB FOR THE OFFERING?” “G-D WILL PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH A LAMB FOR THE OFFERING, MY SON,” REPLIED AVRAHAM, AND THE TWO OF THEM WALKED TOGETHER. THEY CAME TO THE PLACE OF WHICH G-D HAD TOLD HIM. AVRAHAM BUILT THE ALTAR THERE AND ARRANGED THE WOOD. HE BOUND HIS SON YITZCHAK AND PLACED HIM UPON THE WOOD ON THE ALTAR. AVRAHAM THEN STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND, AND TOOK THE KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER HIS SON. AN ANGEL OF G-D CALLED TO HIM FROM HEAVEN, SAYING, “AVRAHAM, AVRAHAM!” HE REPLIED, “HERE I AM.” THE ANGEL SAID: “DO NOT LAY YOUR HAND ON THE YOUTH AND DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO HIM. FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE G-D-FEARING, AND YOU HAVE NOT WITHHELD YOUR ONLY SON FROM ME.” AFTER THAT, AVRAHAM LOOKED UP AND SAW — BEHOLD! A RAM CAUGHT BY ITS HORNS IN THE THICKET. SO AVRAHAM WENT AND TOOK THE RAM AND SACRIFICED IT AS A BURNT-OFFERING INSTEAD OF HIS SON. AVRAHAM NAMED THE PLACE “G-D WILL SEE”, AND SO OF THIS PLACE IT IS SAID TO THIS DAY, “ON THIS MOUNTAIN, G-D WILL BE SEEN.” AN ANGEL OF G-D CALLED TO AVRAHAM A SECOND TIME FROM HEAVEN, SAYING, “G-D DECLARES: ‘I HAVE SWORN BY MY OWN SELF THAT BECAUSE YOU DID THIS DEED, AND DID NOT WITHHOLD YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY ONE, I WILL BLESS YOU GREATLY AND I WILL ABUNDANTLY INCREASE YOUR OFFSPRING LIKE THE STARS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SAND OF THE SEASHORE. AND YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL INHERIT THE GATE OF THEIR ENEMIES. ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD SHALL BE BLESSED BECAUSE OF YOUR OFFSPRING, BECAUSE YOU HEEDED MY VOICE. AVRAHAM RETURNED TO HIS YOUNG MEN. THEY AROSE AND WENT TOGETHER TO BEER-SHEBA, AND AVRAHAM SETTLED IN BEER-SHEBA.</h1>
<h3 class="hint">On the days of Tachanun, recite the following:</h3>
<h1>
    MASTER OF THE WORLD: JUST AS AVRAHAM OUR FATHER SUPPRESSED HIS MERCY FOR HIS ONLY SON IN ORDER TO DO YOUR WILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY, SO TOO, MAY YOUR MERCY SUPPRESS YOUR WRATH FROM [BEING VENTED] UPON US. MAY YOUR MERCY OUTWEIGH YOUR OTHER ATTRIBUTES. MAY YOU DEAL WITH US, G-D OUR L-RD, WITH THE ATTRIBUTE OF KINDNESS AND OF MERCY, AND DEAL WITH US MORE LENIENTLY THAN THE LETTER OF THE LAW. IN YOUR GREAT GOODNESS, MAY YOUR FIERCE ANGER TURN AWAY FROM YOUR PEOPLE, FROM YOUR CITY, FROM YOUR LAND, AND FROM YOUR HERITAGE. FULFILL FOR US, G-D, OUR L-RD, THE PROMISE THAT YOU MADE IN YOUR TORAH THROUGH MOSHE YOUR SERVANT, AS IT IS SAID: “I WILL REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH YAAKOV AND INDEED MY COVENANT WITH YITZCHAK, AND I WILL INDEED REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH AVRAHAM, AND I WILL REMEMBER THE LAND.” AND IT IS SAID: TO ANNUL MY COVENANT WITH THEM, FOR I AM G-D, THEIR L-RD.” AND IT IS SAID: WHOM I TOOK OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, BEFORE THE EYES OF THE NATIONS, TO BE THEIR G-D; I AM THE L-RD.” AND IT IS SAID: HE WILL AGAIN GATHER YOU FROM ALL THE NATIONS AMONG WHICH G-D, YOUR L-RD, HAS SCATTERED YOU. EVEN IF YOUR DISPERSED ONES WILL BE AT THE ENDS OF THE HEAVENS, G-D, YOUR L-RD, WILL GATHER YOU FROM THERE AND TAKE YOU FROM THERE. G-D, YOUR L-RD, WILL BRING YOU TO THE LAND THAT YOUR FATHERS INHERITED, AND YOU WILL INHERIT IT, AND HE WILL BE GENEROUS WITH YOU, AND WILL MAKE YOU MORE NUMEROUS THAN YOUR FATHERS.” AND IT IS SAID: O G-D, TO YOU WE HAVE PRAYED, BE A SEED FOR THE EARLY ONES, AND SAVE US IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE. AND IT IS SAID: IT IS A TIME OF DISTRESS FOR YAAKOV, BUT FROM IT, HE SHALL BE DELIVERED. AND IT IS SAID: IN ALL THEIR AFFLICTION HE WAS AFFLICTED, AND THE ANGEL OF HIS PRESENCE SAVED THEM. WITH HIS LOVE AND COMPASSION, HE REDEEMS THEM; HE BEARS THEM AND CARRIES THEM FOREVER.” AND IT IS SAID: WHO, O G-D, IS LIKE YOU, WHO IS FORBEARING WITH INIQUITY, AND FORGIVES TRANSGRESSION FOR THE REMNANT OF HIS HERITAGE? HE DOES NOT SUSTAIN HIS WRATH FOREVER, FOR HE DESIRES KINDNESS. HE WILL AGAIN BE MERCIFUL TO US; HE WILL SUPPRESS OUR SINS. YOU WILL CAST ALL THEIR SINS INTO THE DEPTH OF THE SEA. GRANT TRUTH TO YAAKOV AND KINDNESS TO AVRAHAM, AS YOU HAVE SWORN TO OUR FATHERS FROM BYGONE DAYS.” AND IT IS SAID: “I WILL BRING THEM TO MY HOLY MOUNTAIN AND HAVE THEM REJOICE IN MY HOUSE OF PRAYER. THEIR BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES WILL BE FAVORABLY ACCEPTED ON MY ALTAR, FOR MY HOUSE WILL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL NATIONS.”
</h1>

<h1>A PERSON SHOULD ALWAYS BE G-D-FEARING IN PRIVATE. HE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH AND SPEAK TRUTH IN HIS HEART. LET HIM ARISE EARLY AND SAY:</h1>

<h1>MASTER OF ALL WORLDS, WE ARE NOT PRESENTING OUR SUPPLICATIONS TO YOU BECAUSE WE RELY ON OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR ABUNDANT MERCIES. OF WHAT WORTH ARE WE?

ARE NOT ALL MIGHTY MEN AS NOTHING BEFORE YOU? ARE NOT THE MEN OF RENOWN AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN, AND THE WISE MEN AS IF BEREFT OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THE MEN OF UNDERSTANDING AS IF WITHOUT INTELLECT? FOR MOST OF THEIR DEEDS ARE EMPTY, AND THE DAYS OF THEIR LIVES ARE WORTHLESS BEFORE YOU. THE SUPERIORITY OF MAN OVER ANIMAL IS NAUGHT, FOR EVERYTHING IS WORTHLESS EXCEPT FOR THE PURE SOUL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE AN ACCOUNT AND A RECKONING BEFORE THE THRONE OF YOUR GLORY. ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE YOU, AS IT IS WRITTEN: “AFTER ALL, NATIONS ARE CONSIDERED LIKE A DROP FROM A BUCKET, LIKE MERE DUST ON THE SCALES; INDEED, HE CAN BLOW ISLANDS AWAY LIKE DUST.”</h1>

<h1>BUT WE ARE YOUR NATION, THE PEOPLE OF YOUR COVENANT: THE DESCENDANTS OF AVRAHAM, WHO LOVED YOU, TO WHOM YOU SWORE ON MOUNT MORIAH. THE OFFSPRING OF YITZCHAK, HIS ONLY SON WHO WAS BOUND ON THE ALTAR AND THE CONGREGATION OF YAAKOV, YOUR SON, YOUR FIRSTBORN, WHOM YOU NAMED YISRAEL AND YESHURUN, OUT OF YOUR LOVE FOR HIM AND YOUR DELIGHT IN HIM.</h1>

<h1>THEREFORE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE, PRAISE AND GLORIFY YOU, AND TO BLESS, SANCTIFY, AND GIVE PRAISE AND THANKFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO YOUR NAME. WE ARE FORTUNATE! HOW GOOD IS OUR PORTION! HOW PLEASANT IS OUR LOT! AND HOW BEAUTIFUL IS OUR INHERITANCE!

THEN HE SHALL REMOVE HIS GARMENTS, PUT ON OTHER GARMENTS, AND TAKE OUT OTHER ASHES BEYOND THE CAMP TO A PURE PLACE. THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR SHALL BE KEPT BURNING ON IT; IT MUST NOT BE EXTINGUISHED. THE KOHEN SHALL BURN WOOD UPON IT, MORNING AFTER MORNING. HE SHALL ARRANGE THE BURNT-OFFERING UPON IT AND BURN THE FAT OF THE PEACE-OFFERINGS UPON IT. A CONSTANT FIRE SHALL BE KEPT BURNING ON THE ALTAR; IT MUST NOT BE EXTINGUISHED.</h1>

<h1>G-D SPOKE TO MOSHE, SAYING, COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF YISRAEL AND TELL THEM: TAKE HEED TO OFFER MY SACRIFICE TO ME AT ITS APPOINTED TIME — MY FOOD FOR MY FIRES, MY SATISFYING FRAGRANCE. TELL THEM: THIS IS THE FIRE-OFFERING THAT YOU SHALL BRING FOR G-D — TWO UNBLEMISHED YEARLING MALE LAMBS A DAY, AS A DAILY BURNT-OFFERING. YOU SHALL MAKE AN OFFERING OF ONE LAMB IN THE MORNING AND AN OFFERING OF A SECOND LAMB IN THE AFTERNOON, TOGETHER WITH A TENTH OF AN EPHAH OF SUPERIOR FLOUR AS A MEAL OFFERING, MIXED WITH A FOURTH OF A HIN OF OIL FROM CRUSHED OLIVES. THIS IS A DAILY BURNT-OFFERING, WHICH YOU SHALL BRING AS IT WAS BROUGHT AT MOUNT SINAI, FOR A SATISFYING FRAGRANCE, A FIRE-OFFERING TO G-D. AND FOR ITS WINE LIBATION, YOU SHALL POUR A QUARTER OF A HIN FOR EACH LAMB ON THE HOLY ALTAR AS A LIBATION OF STRONG WINE TO G-D. AND YOU SHALL OFFER THE SECOND LAMB IN THE AFTERNOON, WITH THE SAME MEAL-OFFERING AND WINE LIBATION AS IN THE MORNING, TO BE A FIRE-OFFERING OF SATISFYING FRAGRANCE TO G-D.</h1>
<h1>HE SHALL SLAUGHTER IT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ALTAR BEFORE G-D. AARON’S SONS, THE PRIESTS, SHALL CAST ITS BLOOD ON THE ALTAR, ON ALL SIDES.</h1>

<h3 class="hint">Ketoret — Incense:</h3>
<h1>YOU ARE G-D, OUR L-RD, AND THE G-D OF OUR FATHERS, BEFORE WHOM OUR ANCESTORS BURNED THE INCENSE-OFFERING WHEN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH STOOD, AS YOU COMMANDED THEM THROUGH MOSHE YOUR PROPHET, AS IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR TORAH.</h1>

<h1>G-D SAID TO MOSHE: TAKE FOR YOURSELF FRAGRANT SPICES: BALM, ONYCHA, AND GALBANUM — FRAGRANT SPICES AND PURE FRANKINCENSE. EACH ONE SHOULD BE WEIGHED INDIVIDUALLY. MAKE IT INTO INCENSE, A COMPOUND AS CRAFTED BY AN EXPERT BLENDER, THOROUGHLY MINGLED, PURE AND HOLY. GRIND SOME OF IT IN A VERY FINE MANNER, AND PLACE SOME OF IT BEFORE THE TABLETS OF TESTIMONY IN THE TENT OF MEETING WHERE I WILL MEET WITH YOU. IT SHALL BE OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF SANCTITY FOR YOU. AND IT IS SAID: AND IN THE AFTERNOON, WHEN AARON KINDLES THE LAMPS, HE SHALL BURN IT. IT IS A DAILY INCENSE-OFFERING TO G-D, TO BE CONTINUED THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS.</h1>
<h1>OUR SAGES TAUGHT: IT CONTAINED 368 MANEH — 365 FOR EACH OF THE DAYS OF THE YEAR, A MANEH FOR EACH DAY, HALF TO BE OFFERED IN THE MORNING AND HALF TOWARD EVENING. OF THE REMAINING THREE MANEH, THE HIGH PRIEST WOULD BRING TWO CUPPED HANDFULS INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES ON YOM KIPPUR. THESE THREE MANEH HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THE MORTAR ON THE DAY BEFORE YOM KIPPUR AND WERE GROUND VERY THOROUGHLY SO THAT THEY WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY FINE. THE INCENSE-OFFERING COMPRISED ELEVEN KINDS OF FRAGRANT SPICES: 1) BALM; 2) ONYCHA; 3) GALBANUM; 4) FRANKINCENSE — EACH COMPONENT WEIGHING SEVENTY MANEH; 5) MUSK; 6) CASSIA; 7) SPIKENARD; 8) SAFFRON — EACH COMPONENT WEIGHING SIXTEEN MANEH; 9) COSTUS, TWELVE MANEH; 10) AROMATIC BARK, THREE MANEH; AND 11) CINNAMON, NINE MANEH. THE FOLLOWING WERE ALSO INCLUDED: CARSHINA LYE, NINE KABIN; AND WINE FROM CYPRUS, THREE SE’AH AND THREE KABIN. IF THERE WAS NO WINE FROM CYPRUS, THEY WOULD USE AGED WHITE WINE. ALSO INCLUDED WERE A QUARTER OF A KAV OF SALT FROM SODOM, AND A MINUTE AMOUNT OF A SMOKE-RAISING HERB.
    RABBI NASSAN THE BABYLONIAN SAYS: A MINUTE AMOUNT OF JORDANIAN AMBER WAS ALSO ADDED. IF HONEY WAS ADDED, THE OFFERING WAS INVALIDATED, AND IF ONE OMITTED ANY OF ITS SPICES, HE WAS LIABLE TO THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE HANDS OF HEAVEN.
</h1>

<h1>RABBAN SHIMON BEN GAMLIEL SAYS: BALM IS SIMPLY THE SAP THAT DRIPS FROM THE BALSAM TREE. CARSHINA LYE WAS USED TO RUB ON THE ONYCHA TO IMPROVE ITS APPEARANCE. WINE FROM CYPRUS SERVED FOR STEEPING THE ONYCHA, TO INTENSIFY ITS FRAGRANCE. ALTHOUGH THE WATER OF RAGLAYIM COULD HAVE SERVED THAT PURPOSE, THE WATER OF RAGLAYIM WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE BEIS HAMIKDASH OUT OF RESPECT.</h1>
<h1>IT IS TAUGHT THAT RABBI NASSAN SAID: AS A PRIEST WOULD GRIND THE INCENSE, ANOTHER WOULD SAY: “GRIND THOROUGHLY; THOROUGHLY GRIND,” FOR THE SOUND IS BENEFICIAL FOR THE SPICES. IF ONE MIXED THE COMPOUND IN HALF QUANTITIES, IT WAS FIT FOR USE. IF ONLY A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE PRESCRIBED COMPOUND WAS MIXED, WE HAVE NOT HEARD WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE FIT FOR USE. RABBI YEHUDAH SAID: THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT IF IT WAS MIXED IN ITS PROPER PROPORTIONS, IT IS FIT FOR USE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS COMPOUNDED IN HALF-QUANTITIES OR EVEN IN LESSER QUANTITIES. A PERSON WHO LEFT OUT ONE OF THE SPICES WAS LIABLE TO THE DEATH PENALTY AT THE HANDS OF HEAVEN.</h1>

<h1>IT IS TAUGHT THAT BAR KAPPARA SAYS: ONCE EVERY SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS, THE ACCUMULATED SURPLUSES WOULD AMOUNT TO HALF THE REQUIRED ANNUAL AMOUNT. BAR KAPPARA ALSO TAUGHT: HAD EVEN A MINUTE QUANTITY OF HONEY BEEN ADDED TO IT, NO MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE AROMA. WHY, THEN, WERE THEY NOT TO MIX HONEY INTO IT? BECAUSE THE TORAH SAYS: “YOU SHALL BURN NO LEAVEN OR ANY HONEY AS A FIRE-OFFERING TO G-D.”</h1>

<h1>ABBAYE WOULD RECOUNT THE SEQUENCE OF OFFERINGS, BEGINNING WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF WOOD ON THE OUTER ALTAR, BASED ON SCHOLARLY TRADITION, ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF ABBA SHAUL. THE LARGE ARRANGEMENT OF WOOD ON THE ALTAR PRECEDED THE SECOND ARRANGEMENT OF WOOD, FROM WHICH COALS WERE TAKEN FOR THE INCENSE-OFFERING. THE SECOND ARRANGEMENT OF WOOD FOR THE INCENSE-OFFERING PRECEDED THE PLACEMENT OF THE TWO LOGS. THE PLACEMENT OF THE TWO LOGS PRECEDED THE CLEARING OF THE ASHES FROM THE INNER ALTAR. THE CLEARING OF THE ASHES FROM THE INNER ALTAR PRECEDED THE CLEANING OF THE FIVE LAMPS OF THE MENORAH. THE CLEANING OF THE FIVE LAMPS PRECEDED THE DASHING OF THE BLOOD OF THE DAILY OFFERING. THE DASHING OF THE BLOOD OF THE DAILY OFFERING PRECEDED THE CLEANING OF THE REMAINING TWO LAMPS OF THE MENORAH. THE CLEANING OF THE TWO LAMPS PRECEDED THE INCENSE-OFFERING. THE INCENSE-OFFERING PRECEDED THE OFFERING OF THE LIMBS ON THE ALTAR. THE OFFERING OF THE LIMBS PRECEDED THE MEAL-OFFERING. THE MEAL-OFFERING PRECEDED THE FRIED CHAVITIN. THE CHAVITIN PRECEDED THE WINE LIBATIONS. THE WINE LIBATIONS PRECEDED THE ADDITIONAL MUSSAF OFFERING. THE ADDITIONAL OFFERING PRECEDED THE TWO BOWLS OF FRANKINCENSE. THE BOWLS OF FRANKINCENSE PRECEDED THE AFTERNOON DAILY OFFERING. THIS SEQUENCE IS INDICATED BY THE VERSE, KOHEN SHALL ARRANGE THE BURNT-OFFERING UPON IT, AND UPON IT HE SHALL BURN THE FAT OF THE PEACE-OFFERINGS.” THIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN “UPON IT” — I.E., AFTER IT, THAT IS, AFTER THE MORNING DAILY OFFERING, YOU SHALL COMPLETE THE OFFERING OF ALL THE SACRIFICES.</h1>

BUT NOW, BECAUSE OF OUR SINS, THE BEIS HAMIKDASH WAS DESTROYED AND THE DAILY OFFERING AND THE INCENSE-OFFERING WERE DISRUPTED.

<h1>1) IN WHAT LOCATIONS WAS THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE PERFORMED? IN BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THE BULL AND THE GOAT OFFERED ON YOM KIPPUR WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE RECEIVED IN A SACRAMENTAL VESSEL IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THAT BLOOD WAS TO BE SPRINKLED BETWEEN THE STAVES OF THE ARK, TOWARD THE CURTAIN BEFORE THE HOLY OF HOLIES, AND ON THE GOLDEN ALTAR. IF EVEN ONE SPRINKLING WAS OMITTED, ATONEMENT WOULD BE WITHHELD. THE KOHEN GADOL POURED OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE BLOOD ON THE BASE AT THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE OUTER ALTAR. IF IT WAS NOT POURED OUT, ATONEMENT WAS NOT WITHHELD.</h1>

<h1>2) THE BULLS AND THE GOATS THAT WERE TO BE BURNED OUTSIDE THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE RECEIVED IN A SACRAMENTAL VESSEL IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THAT BLOOD WAS TO BE SPRINKLED TOWARD THE CURTAIN BEFORE THE HOLY OF HOLIES AND ON THE GOLDEN ALTAR. IF EVEN ONE SPRINKLING WAS OMITTED, ATONEMENT WOULD BE WITHHELD. THE KOHEN PERFORMING THE SERVICE POURED OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE BLOOD ON THE BASE AT THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE OUTER ALTAR. IF IT WAS NOT POURED OUT, ATONEMENT WAS NOT WITHHELD. THE ANIMALS OFFERED IN ALL THE ABOVE SACRIFICES WOULD BE BURNED IN THE PLACE WHERE THE ASHES FROM THE ALTAR WERE DEPOSITED.</h1>

<h1>3) THE FOLLOWING LAWS APPLY TO BOTH THE COMMUNAL AND INDIVIDUAL SIN-OFFERINGS. THESE ARE THE COMMUNAL SIN-OFFERINGS: THE GOATS OFFERED ON ROSH CHODESH AND ON THE FESTIVALS. THEY WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE RECEIVED IN A SACRAMENTAL VESSEL IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD, AND WAS TO BE APPLIED ON THE ALTAR FOUR TIMES, ONCE ON EACH OF THE CORNERS. HOW WAS THIS PERFORMED? THE KOHEN WOULD ASCEND VIA THE RAMP AT THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE ALTAR AND TURN TO THE SURROUNDING WALKWAY ON THE EDGE OF THE ALTAR. HE WOULD APPROACH IN TURN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER, THE NORTHEASTERN CORNER, THE NORTHWESTERN CORNER AND THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER, APPLYING THE BLOOD ON EACH OF THE CORNERS. HE WOULD POUR THE REMAINDER OF THE BLOOD ON THE BASE AT THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE ALTAR. THE MEAT FROM THESE SACRIFICES COULD BE EATEN BY MALE KOHANIM WITHIN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD, PREPARED IN ANY MANNER, DURING THE DAY THE SACRIFICE WAS OFFERED AND ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.</h1>

<h1>4) THE BURNT-OFFERING WAS A SACRIFICE OF THE MOST SACRED ORDER. THE ANIMAL DESIGNATED FOR THIS OFFERING WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. ITS BLOOD WOULD BE RECEIVED IN A SACRAMENTAL VESSEL IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD AND IT WAS TO BE DASHED TWICE ON THE ALTAR IN A MANNER THAT ENABLED IT TO REACH ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE ALTAR. THE HIDE WAS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SACRIFICIAL ANIMAL, WHICH WAS TO BE CUT INTO PORTIONS, AND BURNED ENTIRELY ON THE FIRES OF THE ALTAR.</h1>

<h1>5) THESE ARE THE LAWS APPLYING TO THE COMMUNAL PEACE-OFFERINGS AND THE GUILT-OFFERINGS. THESE ARE THE GUILT-OFFERINGS: HE GUILT-OFFERING BROUGHT FOR ROBBERY, FOR MISAPPROPRIATING CONSECRATED PROPERTY, FOR HAVING RELATIONS WITH A DESIGNATED MAIDSERVANT, THE GUILT-OFFERING OF A NAZIRITE, THE GUILT-OFFERING OF A PERSON AFFLICTED WITH TZARAAS, AND THE CONDITIONAL GUILT-OFFERING. THE ANIMALS DESIGNATED FOR THESE SACRIFICES WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE RECEIVED IN A SACRAMENTAL VESSEL IN THE NORTHERN AREA OF THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD, AND IT WAS TO BE DASHED TWICE ON THE ALTAR IN A MANNER THAT ENABLED IT TO REACH ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE ALTAR. THE MEAT FROM THESE SACRIFICES COULD BE EATEN BY MALE KOHANIM WITHIN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD, PREPARED IN ANY MANNER, DURING THE DAY THE SACRIFICE WAS OFFERED AND ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.</h1>

<h1>6) THE THANKSGIVING-OFFERING AND THE RAM BROUGHT BY A NAZIRITE ARE SACRIFICES OF A LESSER DEGREE OF SANCTITY. THE ANIMALS DESIGNATED FOR THESE SACRIFICES MAY BE SLAUGHTERED IN ANY PLACE WITHIN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WAS TO BE DASHED TWICE ON THE ALTAR IN A MANNER THAT ENABLED IT TO REACH ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE ALTAR. THE MEAT FROM THESE SACRIFICES COULD BE EATEN WITHIN THE ENTIRE CITY OF JERUSALEM, BY ANY PERSON, PREPARED IN ANY MANNER, DURING THE DAY THE SACRIFICE WAS OFFERED AND ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT UNTIL MIDNIGHT. SIMILAR RULES APPLY TO THE PORTIONS TAKEN FROM THEM, EXCEPT THAT THEY COULD BE EATEN SOLELY BY THE KOHANIM, THEIR WIVES, THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR SERVANTS.</h1>

<h1>7) THE PEACE-OFFERINGS ARE LIKEWISE SACRIFICES OF A LESSER DEGREE OF SANCTITY. THE ANIMALS DESIGNATED FOR THESE SACRIFICES MAY BE SLAUGHTERED IN ANY PLACE WITHIN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WOULD BE DASHED TWICE ON THE ALTAR IN A MANNER THAT ENABLED IT TO REACH ALL FOUR SIDES OF THE ALTAR. THE MEAT FROM THESE SACRIFICES COULD BE EATEN WITHIN THE ENTIRE CITY OF JERUSALEM, BY ANY PERSON, PREPARED IN ANY MANNER, DURING THE DAY THE SACRIFICE WAS OFFERED AND ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, AND DURING THE NEXT DAY. SIMILAR RULES APPLY TO THE PORTIONS TAKEN FROM THEM, EXCEPT THAT THEY COULD BE EATEN SOLELY BY THE KOHANIM, THEIR WIVES, THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR SERVANTS.</h1>

<h1>8) THE OFFERING OF FIRSTBORN ANIMALS, THE TITHE-OFFERING, AND THE PASCHAL SACRIFICE ARE ALSO SACRIFICES OF A LESSER DEGREE OF SANCTITY. THE ANIMALS DESIGNATED FOR THESE SACRIFICES MAY BE SLAUGHTERED IN ANY PLACE WITHIN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH COURTYARD. THEIR BLOOD WAS TO BE DASHED ONCE UPON THE WALL OF THE ALTAR, ABOVE ITS BASE. THE RULES FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF THE ABOVE VARY. THE MEAT OF THE OFFERING OF FIRSTBORN ANIMALS COULD BE EATEN SOLELY BY KOHANIM, WHILE THE MEAT OF THE TITHE-OFFERING COULD BE EATEN BY ANY PERSON. THE MEAT FROM THESE SACRIFICES COULD BE EATEN WITHIN THE ENTIRE CITY OF JERUSALEM, PREPARED IN ANY MANNER, DURING THE DAY THE SACRIFICE WAS OFFERED, ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, AND DURING THE NEXT DAY. THE MEAT OF THE PASCHAL SACRIFICE COULD BE EATEN ONLY AT NIGHT, AND ONLY UNTIL MIDNIGHT. IT COULD BE EATEN ONLY BY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN REGISTERED FOR IT, AND IT COULD ONLY BE EATEN ROASTED.</h1>

REMEMBER HIS COVENANT FOREVER, THE WORD THAT HE COMMANDED FOR A THOUSAND GENERATIONS - THE COVENANT THAT HE MADE WITH ABRAHAM, AND THE OATH CONCERNING ISAAC. HE ESTABLISHED IT AS A STATUTE FOR JACOB, FOR ISRAEL AS AN ETERNAL COVENANT, DECLARING: “TO YOU I WILL GRANT THE LAND OF CANAAN, THE LOT OF YOUR INHERITANCE.” THIS PROMISE WAS MADE WHEN YOU WERE FEW IN NUMBER, AND HAD LIVED THERE ONLY BRIEFLY.

<h1>BLESSED BE HE WHO SPOKE, AND THE WORLD CAME INTO BEING; BLESSED BE HE. BLESSED BE HE WHO SPEAKS, AND ACTS ACCORDINGLY. BLESSED BE HE WHO DECREES, AND FULFILLS. BLESSED BE HE WHO CREATES THE UNIVERSE. BLESSED BE HE WHO HAS COMPASSION ON THE LAND. BLESSED BE HE WHO HAS COMPASSION ON THE CREATED BEINGS. BLESSED BE HE WHO GRANTS A GENEROUS REWARD TO THOSE WHO FEAR HIM. BLESSED BE HE WHO LIVES FOREVER AND EXISTS FOR ALL TIME. BLESSED BE HE WHO REDEEMS AND SAVES. BLESSED BE HIS NAME. BLESSED ARE YOU, GOD OUR LORD, KING OF THE UNIVERSE, THE BENEVOLENT GOD AND MERCIFUL FATHER, WHO IS PRAISED BY THE MOUTH OF HIS PEOPLE, AND EXALTED AND GLORIFIED BY THE TONGUE OF HIS PIOUS ONES AND BY HIS SERVANTS, AND BY THE SONGS OF DAVID, YOUR SERVANT. WE SHALL EXTOL YOU, GOD OUR LORD, WITH PRAISES AND MUSIC; WE SHALL MAGNIFY, EXALT AND GLORIFY YOU; WE SHALL AFFIRM YOUR SOVEREIGNTY AND RECALL YOUR NAME, OUR KING, OUR GOD. YOU ARE UNIQUE, GRANTING LIFE TO THE WORLDS, THE KING. PRAISED AND GLORIFIED FOREVER IS HIS GREAT NAME. BLESSED ARE YOU, GOD, THE KING WHO IS EXTOLLED WITH PRAISES.</h1>
<h3 class="hint">The following psalm #100 is not said on a day when Pesach starts, during the whole Pesach and on the day The Yom Kippur starts.</h3>
<h1>A PSALM OF THANKSGIVING. LET THE ENTIRE EARTH CALL OUT TO GOD IN JUBILATION. SERVE GOD WITH HAPPINESS, COME BEFORE HIM WITH JOYOUS SONG. KNOW THAT GOD IS THE LORD. HE MADE US, AND WE ARE HIS, HIS NATION, THE SHEEP THAT HE PASTURES. ENTER HIS GATES WITH THANKSGIVING, HIS COURTYARDS WITH PRAISE. GIVE THANKS TO HIM, BLESS HIS NAME. FOR GOD IS GOOD. HIS KINDNESS IS EVERLASTING, AND HIS FAITHFULNESS ENDURES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.</h1>
<h1>MAY THE GLORY OF GOD ENDURE FOREVER; MAY GOD REJOICE IN HIS WORKS. MAY THE NAME OF GOD BE BLESSED FROM NOW UNTIL ETERNITY. FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN UNTIL ITS SETTING, THE NAME OF GOD IS PRAISED. SUPREME ABOVE ALL NATIONS IS GOD, HIS GLORY IS UPON THE HEAVENS. GOD, YOUR NAME ENDURES FOREVER; GOD, YOUR REMEMBRANCE ENDURES FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. GOD ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE IN THE HEAVENS, AND HIS SOVEREIGNTY RULES OVER ALL. LET THE HEAVENS REJOICE; LET THE EARTH BE GLAD; AND LET IT BE SAID AMONG ALL THE NATIONS: “GOD REIGNS!” GOD IS KING; GOD HAS BEEN KING; GOD WILL BE KING FOREVER AND EVER. GOD REIGNS FOR ETERNITY; THE NATIONS WILL VANISH FROM HIS LAND. GOD FOILS THE DESIGNS OF NATIONS; HE THWARTS THE THOUGHTS OF PEOPLES. THERE ARE MANY THOUGHTS IN THE HEART OF MAN, BUT THE COUNSEL OF GOD WILL PREVAIL. THE COUNSEL OF GOD WILL ENDURE FOREVER; THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. FOR HE SPOKE, AND THE WORLD CAME INTO BEING; HE COMMANDED, AND IT ENDURED. FOR GOD HAS CHOSEN ZION; HE DESIRED IT FOR HIS DWELLING PLACE. FOR GOD HAS CHOSEN JACOB AS HIS OWN, ISRAEL AS HIS CHERISHED ONE. FOR GOD WILL NEVER ABANDON HIS NATION; HE WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS HERITAGE. AND HE IS COMPASSIONATE, FORGIVING OF SIN, AND WILL NOT DESTROY. MANY TIMES HE WITHDRAWS HIS ANGER AND DOES NOT FULLY AROUSE HIS WRATH. GOD, DELIVER US. MAY THE KING ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL.</h1>
<h1>
    FORTUNATE ARE THOSE WHO DWELL IN YOUR HOUSE; FORTUNATE ARE THOSE WHO VISIT THE HOLY TEMPLE. THEY WILL PRAISE YOU FOREVER. FORTUNATE IS THE NATION THAT SUCH IS THEIR LOT: FORTUNATE IS THE NATION WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD.
    THE FOLLOWING IS A SONG OF PRAISE COMPOSED BY KING DAVID: I WILL EXALT YOU, MY GOD, THE KING, AND I WILL BLESS YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER. I WILL BLESS YOU EVERY DAY, AND I WILL PRAISE YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER.
    HOWEVER, MUCH I PRAISE THE LORD, IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH, BECAUSE HE IS SO GREAT AND PRAISED; THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HIS GREATNESS. THE OLDER GENERATION WILL PRAISE YOUR WORKS OF CREATION TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR ACTS OF STRENGTH. I, TOO, WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THE UNIVERSE YOU CREATED AND THE HONOR IT BRINGS YOU, AS WELL AS THE WONDERS AND MIRACLES YOU HAVE DONE. THE OLDER GENERATION WILL TELL THE YOUNGER GENERATION ABOUT THE MIGHT OF YOUR AWESOME ACTS, AND I WILL SPEAK ABOUT YOUR GREATNESS. THEY WILL TELL THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT THE MEMORIES OF YOUR GREAT GOODNESS TO THEM, AND THEY WILL SING TO EVERYONE ABOUT YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. THE LORD IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL, EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T DESERVE IT. HE IS SLOW TO GET ANGRY AND PUNISH THOSE WHO DON'T LISTEN TO HIM; AND HE TREATS THEM WITH GREAT KINDNESS IF THEY REPENT. THE LORD IS GOOD TO EVERY LIVING THING, AND HE HAS MERCY ON ALL HIS CREATIONS. LORD, ALL YOUR CREATIONS WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU, AND YOUR DEVOTED PEOPLE WILL BLESS YOU. THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE MAJESTY OF YOUR KINGDOM; THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT YOUR GREAT STRENGTH. THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT THESE THINGS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT GOD'S MIGHTY ACTS, AND THE HONORABLE BEAUTY OF HIS KINGDOM.
    GOD, YOUR KINGDOM IS A KINGDOM THAT INCLUDES ALL WORLDS, AND YOUR RULERSHIP OVER THE WORLDS WILL CONTINUE FOREVER, THROUGHOUT ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE LORD SUPPORTS ALL THOSE WHO FALL, AND HE STRAIGHTENS THOSE WHO ARE BENT.
    GOD, EVERYONE'S EYES LOOK HOPEFULLY TO YOU FOR HELP, AND YOU GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME. YOU OPEN YOUR HAND AND PROVIDE ENOUGH FOOD TO SATISFY THE DESIRES OF EVERY LIVING BEING. THE LORD IS FAIR IN ALL HIS WAYS, AND HE IS KIND IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. THE LORD IS CLOSE TO ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM, AND HE ANSWERS ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM TRUTHFULLY AND HONESTLY. HE FULFILLS THE DESIRES AND NEEDS OF THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; HE HEARS THEIR CRIES FOR HELP, AND HE SAVES THEM.
    THE LORD WATCHES OVER ALL THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, AND HE WILL DESTROY ALL THE EVIL PEOPLE. MY MOUTH WILL SAY THE PRAISES OF THE LORD, AND EVERYONE WILL DO THE SAME AND BLESS HIS HOLY NAME FOREVER AND EVER. WE WILL BLESS GOD, NOW AND FOREVER. PRAISE THE LORD.
</h1>
<h1>PRAISE GOD. MY SOUL, PRAISE GOD. I WILL PRAISE GOD DURING MY LIFE, I WILL MAKE MUSIC TO MY LORD WHILE I EXIST. DO NOT TRUST IN GENEROUS NOBLES, IN A MORTAL WHO CANNOT BRING DELIVERANCE. WHEN HIS SPIRIT DEPARTS, HE WILL RETURN TO HIS EARTH; ON THAT DAY ALL HIS DESIGNS PERISH. FORTUNATE IS HE WHOSE HELP IS THE GOD OF JACOB, WHOSE HOPE FOCUSES ON GOD, HIS LORD. HE MAKES THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH, THE SEA AND EVERYTHING IT CONTAINS; HE KEEPS THE TRUTH OF HIS PROMISE TO CREATED BEINGS FOREVER. HE EXECUTES JUDGMENT ON BEHALF OF THE OPPRESSED; HE GIVES BREAD TO THE HUNGRY; GOD RELEASES THE BOUND. GOD OPENS THE EYES OF THE BLIND; GOD STRAIGHTENS THE BENT; GOD LOVES THE RIGHTEOUS. GOD PROTECTS THE STRANGERS; HE STRENGTHENS THE ORPHAN AND THE WIDOW; HE TWISTS THE PATH OF THE WICKED. GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER – YOUR LORD, O ZION – FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. PRAISE GOD.</h1>
<h1>PRAISE GOD. IT IS GOOD TO MAKE MUSIC FOR OUR GOD, FOR PRAISE TO HIS NAME IS PLEASANT AND ATTRACTIVE. GOD IS THE BUILDER OF JERUSALEM; HE WILL GATHER THE DISPERSED OF ISRAEL. HE HEALS THE BROKEN-HEARTED, HE BINDS UP THEIR SORROW. HE COUNTS THE SUM OF THE STARS, NAMING THEM ALL. OUR LORD IS GREAT AND ABUNDANT IN POWER; HIS UNDERSTANDING CANNOT BE DESCRIBED. GOD RAISES THE SPIRITS OF THE HUMBLE; HE HUMBLES THE WICKED DOWN TO THE GROUND. CALL OUT TO GOD IN THANKS, WITH A HARP MAKE MUSIC TO OUR LORD. WHO COVERS THE HEAVENS WITH CLOUDS, WHO PREPARES RAIN FOR THE EARTH, WHO CAUSES GRASS TO GROW ON THE MOUNTAINS, WHO GIVES ANIMALS THEIR FOOD, TO THE OFFSPRING OF THE RAVEN THAT CALL OUT. HE DOES NOT DESIRE THOSE WHO TRUST IN THE MIGHT OF THE HORSE, NOR DOES HE FAVOR THOSE WHO TRUST IN THE THIGHS OF MAN. GOD DESIRES THOSE WHO FEAR HIM, THOSE WHO LONG FOR HIS KINDNESS. PRAISE GOD, O JERUSALEM; ZION, ACCLAIM YOUR LORD. FOR HE HAS STRENGTHENED THE BOLTS OF YOUR GATES, AND BLESSED YOUR CHILDREN IN YOUR MIDST. HE HAS GRANTED PEACE TO YOUR BORDERS, AND SATIATED YOU WITH THE CREAM OF THE WHEAT. HE SENDS HIS DECREES EARTHWARD; HIS WORD RUNS SWIFTLY. HE GIVES SNOW LIKE FLEECE; HE SCATTERS FROST LIKE ASHES. HE CASTS HIS ICE LIKE CRUMBS; WHO CAN WITHSTAND HIS COLD? HE SENDS FORTH HIS WORD AND IT MELTS THEM; HE CAUSES HIS WIND TO BLOW AND WATER FLOWS. HE RELATES HIS WORD TO JACOB, HIS STATUTES AND JUDGMENTS TO ISRAEL. HE DID NOT DO THIS FOR OTHER NATIONS, NOR DO THEY KNOW THESE JUDGMENTS. PRAISE GOD.</h1>
<h1>PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD FROM THE HEAVENS. PRAISE HIM IN THE LOFTY HEIGHTS. PRAISE HIM, ALL HIS ANGELS. PRAISE HIM, ALL HIS HOSTS. PRAISE HIM, SUN AND MOON. PRAISE HIM, ALL THE STARS THAT SHINE. PRAISE HIM, THE LOFTIEST OF THE HEAVENS, AND THE WATERS THAT ARE ABOVE THE HEAVENS. LET THEM PRAISE THE NAME OF GOD, BECAUSE HE COMMANDED, AND THEY WERE CREATED. HE ESTABLISHED THEM FOREVER, FOR ALL TIME. HE LAID DOWN A STATUTE, AND IT SHALL NOT BE CONTRAVENED. PRAISE GOD FROM THE EARTH, THE SEA-SERPENTS AND ALL THE CREATURES OF THE WATERY DEPTHS. FIRE AND HAIL, SNOW AND STEAM, THE STORMY WIND THAT CARRIES OUT HIS COMMAND. MOUNTAINS AND ALL THE HILLS, FRUIT TREES AND ALL CEDARS. WILD BEASTS AND ALL DOMESTICATED ANIMALS, CRAWLING CREATURES AND WINGED FOWL. THE KINGS OF THE EARTH AND ALL NATIONS. NOBLES AND ALL THE JUDGES OF THE LAND. YOUNG MEN AND MAIDENS, ELDERS WITH YOUTH - LET THEM ALL PRAISE THE NAME OF GOD, FOR HIS NAME IS EXALTED ALONE. HIS GLORY IS UPON THE EARTH AND HEAVEN. HE RAISED A STANDARD FOR HIS NATION, GENERATING PRAISE FOR ALL HIS PIOUS ONES – FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM. PRAISE GOD.</h1>
<h1>PRAISE GOD. SING A NEW SONG TO GOD. HIS PRAISE WILL BE RELATED IN THE CONGREGATION OF THE PIOUS. LET ISRAEL REJOICE IN ITS MAKER. LET THE CHILDREN OF ZION DELIGHT IN THEIR KING. LET THEM PRAISE HIS NAME WITH THE FLUTE. LET THEM PLAY MUSIC TO HIM WITH THE DRUM AND THE HARP. FOR GOD FAVORS HIS PEOPLE. HE ADORNS THE HUMBLE WITH SALVATION. THE PIOUS WILL CELEBRATE WITH THIS HONOR. THEY WILL SING JOYOUSLY ON THEIR BEDS. THE EXALTATION OF GOD IS IN THEIR THROATS AND A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD IS IN THEIR HAND – TO BRING VENGEANCE UPON THE NATIONS, TO INFLICT PUNISHMENT UPON THE PEOPLES, TO BIND THEIR KINGS IN CHAINS, AND THEIR HONORED ONES IN IRON FETTERS, TO EXECUTE THE PRESCRIBED JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM – THUS BRINGING GLORY TO ALL HIS PIOUS ONES. PRAISE GOD.</h1>
<h1>PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD IN HIS HOLY PLACE. PRAISE HIM IN THE FIRMAMENT WHERE HIS POWER IS MANIFEST. PRAISE HIM BY RELATING HIS MIGHTY ACTS. PRAISE HIM ACCORDING TO HIS ABUNDANT GREATNESS. PRAISE HIM BY SOUNDING THE SHOFAR. PRAISE HIM WITH A NEVEL AND A HARP. PRAISE HIM WITH A DRUM AND A FLUTE. PRAISE HIM WITH AN ORGAN AND A PIPE. PRAISE HIM WITH RESOUNDING CYMBALS, PRAISE HIM WITH RESOUNDING TRUMPETS. LET EVERY SOUL PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD. LET EVERY SOUL PRAISE GOD. PRAISE GOD.</h1>

<h1>AND DAVID BLESSED GOD IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY, AND DAVID SAID: “BLESSED ARE YOU, GOD, THE LORD OF OUR FATHER ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME. THE GREATNESS, THE MIGHT, THE SPLENDOR, THE VICTORY, AND THE GLORY THAT I HAVE BEEN GRANTED ARE ALL YOURS, FOR EVERYTHING IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH IS YOURS. KINGSHIP AND THE RULE OF ALL LEADERS DERIVES FROM YOU. WEALTH AND HONOR COME FROM YOU, AND YOU RULE OVER ALL. IN YOUR HAND ARE STRENGTH AND MIGHT. AND IT IS IN YOUR HAND TO GRANT ANYONE GREATNESS AND STRENGTH. AND NOW, OUR GOD, WE THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOU AND PRAISE YOUR SPLENDID NAME. LET ISRAEL BLESS YOUR GLORIOUS NAME, FOR YOU ARE EXALTED ABOVE ALL BLESSING AND PRAISE. YOU ALONE ARE GOD. YOU MADE THE HEAVENS AND THE HIGHEST CELESTIAL HEIGHTS AND ALL THEIR HOSTS, THE EARTH AND EVERYTHING THAT IS UPON IT, THE SEAS AND EVERYTHING WITHIN THEM. YOU GRANT LIFE TO THEM ALL, AND THE HEAVENLY LEGIONS BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU. YOU ARE GOD THE LORD WHO CHOSE AVRAM, AND BROUGHT HIM OUT FROM UR OF THE CHALDEES, AND NAMED HIM ABRAHAM. AND YOU FOUND HIS HEART FAITHFUL BEFORE YOU –</h1>
<h1>– TO ESTABLISH THE COVENANT WITH HIM TO GIVE HIM THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES, THE HITTITES, THE AMORITES, THE PERIZITES, THE JEBUSITES AND THE GIRGASHITES, TO GIVE IT TO HIS DESCENDANTS, AND YOU UPHELD YOUR WORD, FOR YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS. AND YOU SAW THE OPPRESSION OF OUR ANCESTORS IN EGYPT, AND YOU HEARD THEIR OUTCRY AT THE SEA OF REEDS. AND YOU PERFORMED SIGNS AND WONDERS AGAINST PHARAOH AND ALL HIS SERVANTS AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF HIS LAND, FOR YOU KNEW THAT THEY HAD ACTED WICKEDLY TOWARD OUR FOREFATHERS. IN DOING SO, YOU BROUGHT YOURSELF RENOWN THAT CONTINUES UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY. YOU SPLIT THE SEA BEFORE THEM, AND THEY PASSED THROUGH THE SEA ON DRY LAND, AND YOU THRUST THEIR PURSUERS INTO THE DEPTHS LIKE A STONE IN FIERCE WATERS.</h1>
<h1>AND GOD DELIVERED ISRAEL FROM THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS ON THAT DAY, AND ISRAEL SAW THE EGYPTIANS DEAD ON THE SHORE OF THE SEA. ISRAEL SAW THE MIGHTY HAND THAT GOD HAD WIELDED AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS, AND THE PEOPLE FEARED GOD, AND THEY BELIEVED IN GOD AND IN MOSES, HIS SERVANT.</h1>
<h1>THEN MOSES AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SANG THIS SONG TO GOD. THEY DECLARED RESPONSIVELY: I WILL SING TO GOD FOR HE IS EXCEEDINGLY EXALTED. HE HAS CAST THE HORSE AND ITS RIDER INTO THE SEA. THE MIGHT AND THE VENGEANCE OF GOD BECAME MY SALVATION. THIS IS MY GOD, AND I WILL MAKE A DWELLING FOR HIM, THE GOD OF MY FATHER AND I WILL EXALT HIM. GOD IS A MASTER OF WAR. GOD IS HIS NAME. HE CAST PHARAOH’S CHARIOTS AND FORCES INTO THE SEA. HIS CHOSEN OFFICERS WERE DROWNED IN THE SEA OF REEDS. THE WATERY DEPTHS COVERED THEM. THEY FELL TO THE DEPTHS LIKE A STONE. YOUR RIGHT HAND, O GOD, IS GLORIFIED WITH POWER. YOUR RIGHT HAND, O GOD, SHATTERS THE ENEMY. IN YOUR ABUNDANT GRANDEUR, YOU DESTROY THOSE WHO RISE AGAINST YOU. YOU SEND FORTH YOUR RAGE. IT CONSUMES THEM LIKE STRAW. BY THE BREATH OF YOUR NOSTRILS THE WATERS PILED UP. THE FLOWING WATERS STOOD UPRIGHT LIKE A WALL. THE DEEP WATERS CONGEALED IN THE HEART OF THE SEA. THE ENEMY SAID: “I WILL PURSUE. I WILL OVERTAKE. I WILL DIVIDE THE BOOTY. MY DESIRE WILL BE FULFILLED WITH THEM. I WILL UNSHEATHE MY SWORD. MY HAND WILL OBLITERATE THEM.” YOU BLEW WITH YOUR WIND AND THE SEA COVERED THEM. THEY SANK LIKE LEAD IN THE MIGHTY WATERS. WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE MIGHTY, O GOD. WHO IS LIKE YOU, GLORIFIED IN HOLINESS, AWESOME IN PRAISE, WORKING WONDERS. YOU STRETCHED OUT YOUR RIGHT HAND, THE EARTH SWALLOWED THEM. IN YOUR KINDNESS, YOU LED THIS PEOPLE WHOM YOU REDEEMED. YOU GUIDED THEM WITH YOUR STRENGTH TO YOUR HOLY DWELLING. THE NATIONS HEARD AND WERE AGITATED. A SHUDDER GRIPPED THE INHABITANTS OF PHILISTIA. THE LORDS OF EDOM WERE TERRIFIED. THE MIGHTY MEN OF MO’AV WERE GRIPPED BY TREMBLING. ALL THE INHABITANTS OF CANAAN MELTED AWAY. MAY DREAD AND FEAR FALL UPON THEM. BY THE GREATNESS OF YOUR ARM THEY FELL SILENT, LIKE A STONE – UNTIL YOUR NATION CROSSES, O GOD. UNTIL THIS NATION YOU ACQUIRED CROSSES OVER. YOU WILL BRING THEM AND PLANT THEM ON THE MOUNTAIN OF YOUR INHERITANCE, THE PLACE THAT YOU, O GOD, ESTABLISHED FOR YOUR DWELLING, THE SANCTUARY THAT YOUR HANDS, O GOD, MADE. GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER. GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER. THE KINGDOM OF GOD ENDURES FOREVER AND EVER. WHEN PHARAOH’S HORSES WITH HIS CHARIOTS AND RIDERS ENTERED THE SEA, GOD TURNED THE WATERS OF THE SEA BACK UPON THEM, WHILE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WALKED ON DRY LAND IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA. FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS GOD’S. HE RULES OVER THE NATIONS. AND DELIVERERS WILL ASCEND TO MOUNT ZION TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU, AND SOVEREIGNTY WILL BE GOD’S. AND GOD WILL BE KING OVER THE ENTIRE EARTH. ON THAT DAY, GOD WILL BE ONE AND HIS NAME, ONE.</h1>

HIS WORDS ARE ALIVE AND ENDURING, FAITHFUL AND DESIRABLE FOREVER AND FOR ALL ETERNITY, FOR OUR FATHERS AND FOR US, FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS, AND FOR ALL THE GENERATIONS OF THE DESCENDANTS OF ISRAEL, YOUR SERVANTS. FOR THE FIRST AND LAST GENERATIONS, IT IS A GOOD AND ENDURING MATTER IN TRUTH AND IN FAITHFULNESS, A LAW THAT WILL NEVER BE REVOKED. IT IS TRUE THAT YOU ARE GOD, OUR LORD AND THE LORD OF OUR ANCESTORS, OUR KING AND THE KING OF OUR FATHERS, OUR REDEEMER AND THE REDEEMER OF OUR FATHERS, OUR ROCK, THE ROCK OF OUR DELIVERANCE, OUR LIBERATOR AND OUR RESCUER – THIS IS YOUR NAME FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. WE HAVE NO OTHER GOD ASIDE FROM YOU, FOREVER.</h1>

<h1>FOR ALL TIME, YOU HAVE BEEN THE HELP OF OUR FATHERS, A SHIELD AND A DELIVERER FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN AFTER THEM IN EVERY GENERATION. YOUR DWELLING IS IN THE HEIGHTS OF THE UNIVERSE, AND YOUR JUDGMENTS AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS EXTEND TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. TRULY, A PERSON WHO HEEDS YOUR COMMANDMENTS AND TAKES YOUR COMMANDMENTS AND YOUR WORD TO HEART IS FORTUNATE. TRULY, YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR NATION AND A MIGHTY KING WHO PLEADS THEIR CAUSE, FOR THE FATHERS AND THE SONS. TRULY, YOU ARE THE FIRST AND YOU ARE THE LAST. ASIDE FROM YOU, WE HAVE NO KING, REDEEMER AND DELIVERER. TRULY, GOD OUR LORD, THAT YOU DELIVERED US FROM EGYPT AND LIBERATED US FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. YOU SLEW ALL THEIR FIRSTBORN, AND REDEEMED ISRAEL, YOUR FIRSTBORN. YOU SPLIT THE SEA OF REEDS ON THEIR BEHALF. YOU DROWNED THE BRAZEN AND ENABLED THE CHERISHED ONES TO PASS THROUGH. THE WATERS COVERED THEIR FOES, NOT ONE OF THEM REMAINED. FOR THIS, THE BELOVED PEOPLE PRAISED AND EXALTED THE ALMIGHTY. THE CHERISHED ONES OFFERED MUSIC, SONGS, PRAISES, BLESSINGS AND THANKS TO THE KING, THE LIVING AND ENDURING GOD. HE IS LOFTY AND EXALTED, GREAT AND AWESOME. HE LOWERS THE HAUGHTY TO THE GROUND, AND RAISES THE LOWLY ON HIGH. HE RELEASES PRISONERS, REDEEMS THE HUMBLE, HELPS THE POOR. IT IS HE WHO ANSWERS HIS NATION ISRAEL WHEN THEY CRY OUT TO HIM. HERE ONE SHOULD STAND. THEY OFFERED PRAISES TO THE SUPREME GOD, THEIR REDEEMER. BLESSED IS HE AND HE IS BLESSED. MOSES AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SANG A SONG TO YOU WITH GREAT JOY. THEY ALL PROCLAIMED:</h1>
<h1>“WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE MIGHTY, O GOD! WHO IS LIKE YOU, GLORIFIED IN HOLINESS, AWESOME IN PRAISE, WORKING WONDERS!”</h1>
<h1>WITH A NEW SONG, THE REDEEMED ONES PRAISED YOUR GREAT NAME ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA. TOGETHER, THEY ALL GAVE THANKS AND ACCEPTED YOUR SOVEREIGNTY, SAYING, “GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER.” AND IT IS SAID, “OUR REDEEMER, THE GOD OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME, THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL.” BLESSED ARE YOU, GOD, WHO REDEEMED ISRAEL.</h1>

WE BESEECH YOU, O GOD, ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL. FOR YOU, O GOD, WE HOPE. FOR YOU, O GOD, WE ARE WAITING. FOR YOU, O GOD, DO WE LONG. DO NOT BE SILENT AND DO NOT LET US BE OPPRESSED. FOR THE NATIONS DECLARE, “THEIR HOPE IS LOST.” LET EVERY KNEE BOW DOWN TO YOU AND MAY ALL THOSE WHO STAND UPRIGHT PROSTRATE THEMSELVES BEFORE YOU.</h1>

<h1>
    HE WHO OPENS HIS HAND .TO ACCEPT. REPENTANCE, TO ACCEPT TRANSGRESSORS AND SINNERS: OUR SOUL IS SHAKEN FROM THE EXTENT OF OUR SORROW. DO NOT FORGET US FOREVER. ARISE AND DELIVER US. DO NOT POUR OUT YOUR FURY UPON US, FOR WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE, THE CHILDREN OF YOUR COVENANT. AROUSE YOUR MIGHT AND DELIVER US FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR NAME. DO NOT VIEW OUR TRAVAILS AS TRIFLING. LET YOUR MERCIES SPEEDILY COME TOWARD US IN THE TIME OF OUR DISTRESS. DO NOT ACT FOR OUR SAKE, BUT FOR YOUR OWN. DO NOT DESTROY THE REMEMBRANCE OF OUR REMNANT, FOR OUR EYES LONG FOR YOU, FOR YOU ARE A GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL KING. REMEMBER THE TESTIMONY THAT WE ALWAYS DECLARE, TWICE EVERY DAY WITH LOVE: HEAR, O YISRAEL, GOD IS OUR LORD, GOD IS ONE.

<h1>GAZE DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND SEE THAT WE HAVE BECOME AN OBJECT OF SCORN AND DERISION AMONG THE NATIONS.

PLEASE, DO NOT FORGET US.</h1>

<h1>GOD, LORD OF YISRAEL, TURN AWAY FROM THE FURY OF YOUR WRATH AND RELENT FROM THE EVIL TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE.</h1>

WE BESEECH YOU, RELENT FROM YOUR FURY, AND HAVE MERCY ON THE PEOPLE YOU CHOSE AS YOUR TREASURE.</h1>

<h1>GOD, LORD OF YISRAEL, TURN AWAY FROM THE FURY OF YOUR WRATH AND RELENT FROM THE EVIL TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE.</h1>

<h1>O GOD, HAVE PITY UPON US IN YOUR MERCY. DO NOT PLACE US IN THE HANDS OF CRUEL PEOPLE. WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY, “WHERE IS THEIR GOD?” FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, PERFORM KINDNESS FOR US. DO NOT DELAY. WE BESEECH YOU, RELENT FROM YOUR FURY, AND HAVE MERCY ON THE PEOPLE YOU CHOSE AS YOUR TREASURE.</h1>

<h1>GOD, LORD OF YISRAEL, TURN AWAY FROM THE FURY OF YOUR WRATH AND RELENT FROM THE EVIL TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE.</h1>

NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOUR NAME; PLEASE, DO NOT FORGET US.</h1>

<h1>HELP US, O GOD OF OUR DELIVERANCE, FOR THE SAKE OF THE HONOR OF YOUR NAME. SAVE US AND GRANT US ATONEMENT FOR OUR SINS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR NAME.</h1>

<h1>GOD, LORD OF YISRAEL, TURN AWAY FROM THE FURY OF YOUR WRATH AND RELENT FROM THE EVIL TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE.</h1>

<h1>GUARDIAN OF YISRAEL, GUARD THE REMNANT OF YISRAEL. DO NOT ALLOW YISRAEL — THOSE WHO SAY “HEAR O YISRAEL” — TO PERISH.</h1>

<h1>GUARDIAN OF THE ONE NATION, GUARD THE REMNANT OF THAT ONE NATION. DO NOT ALLOW THAT ONE NATION — WHO PROCLAIM THE UNITY OF YOUR NAME, SAYING, “GOD IS OUR LORD, GOD IS ONE” — TO PERISH.</h1>

<h1>GUARDIAN OF THE HOLY NATION, GUARD THE REMNANT OF THAT HOLY NATION. DO NOT ALLOW THE HOLY NATION — WHO OFFER THREEFOLD SANCTIFICATION TO THE HOLY ONE — TO PERISH.</h1>
<h1>YOU WHO ARE APPEASED BY PLEAS FOR MERCY AND ARE CONCILIATED BY SUPPLICATIONS, BE APPEASED AND CONCILIATED TOWARD THIS POOR GENERATION, FOR THERE IS NONE OTHER TO HELP US.</h1>

<h1>
    FORTUNATE ARE THOSE WHO DWELL IN YOUR HOUSE; FORTUNATE ARE THOSE WHO VISIT THE HOLY TEMPLE. THEY WILL PRAISE YOU FOREVER. FORTUNATE IS THE NATION THAT SUCH IS THEIR LOT: FORTUNATE IS THE NATION WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD.
    THE FOLLOWING IS A SONG OF PRAISE COMPOSED BY KING DAVID: I WILL EXALT YOU, MY GOD, THE KING, AND I WILL BLESS YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER. I WILL BLESS YOU EVERY DAY, AND I WILL PRAISE YOUR NAME FOREVER AND EVER.
    HOWEVER, MUCH I PRAISE THE LORD, IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH, BECAUSE HE IS SO GREAT AND PRAISED; THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HIS GREATNESS. THE OLDER GENERATION WILL PRAISE YOUR WORKS OF CREATION TO THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR ACTS OF STRENGTH. I, TOO, WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF THE UNIVERSE YOU CREATED AND THE HONOR IT BRINGS YOU, AS WELL AS THE WONDERS AND MIRACLES YOU HAVE DONE. THE OLDER GENERATION WILL TELL THE YOUNGER GENERATION ABOUT THE MIGHT OF YOUR AWESOME ACTS, AND I WILL SPEAK ABOUT YOUR GREATNESS. THEY WILL TELL THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT THE MEMORIES OF YOUR GREAT GOODNESS TO THEM, AND THEY WILL SING TO EVERYONE ABOUT YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. THE LORD IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL, EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T DESERVE IT. HE IS SLOW TO GET ANGRY AND PUNISH THOSE WHO DON'T LISTEN TO HIM; AND HE TREATS THEM WITH GREAT KINDNESS IF THEY REPENT. THE LORD IS GOOD TO EVERY LIVING THING, AND HE HAS MERCY ON ALL HIS CREATIONS. LORD, ALL YOUR CREATIONS WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU, AND YOUR DEVOTED PEOPLE WILL BLESS YOU. THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE MAJESTY OF YOUR KINGDOM; THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT YOUR GREAT STRENGTH. THEY WILL SPEAK ABOUT THESE THINGS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT GOD'S MIGHTY ACTS, AND THE HONORABLE BEAUTY OF HIS KINGDOM.
    GOD, YOUR KINGDOM IS A KINGDOM THAT INCLUDES ALL WORLDS, AND YOUR RULERSHIP OVER THE WORLDS WILL CONTINUE FOREVER, THROUGHOUT ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE LORD SUPPORTS ALL THOSE WHO FALL, AND HE STRAIGHTENS THOSE WHO ARE BENT.
    GOD, EVERYONE'S EYES LOOK HOPEFULLY TO YOU FOR HELP, AND YOU GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME. YOU OPEN YOUR HAND AND PROVIDE ENOUGH FOOD TO SATISFY THE DESIRES OF EVERY LIVING BEING. THE LORD IS FAIR IN ALL HIS WAYS, AND HE IS KIND IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. THE LORD IS CLOSE TO ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM, AND HE ANSWERS ALL THOSE WHO CALL OUT TO HIM TRUTHFULLY AND HONESTLY. HE FULFILLS THE DESIRES AND NEEDS OF THOSE WHO FEAR HIM; HE HEARS THEIR CRIES FOR HELP, AND HE SAVES THEM.
    THE LORD WATCHES OVER ALL THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, AND HE WILL DESTROY ALL THE EVIL PEOPLE. MY MOUTH WILL SAY THE PRAISES OF THE LORD, AND EVERYONE WILL DO THE SAME AND BLESS HIS HOLY NAME FOREVER AND EVER. WE WILL BLESS GOD, NOW AND FOREVER. PRAISE THE LORD.
</h1>

<h3>On the days of Tachanun, recite the following:</h3>
<h1>TO THE LEAD MUSICIAN, A MUSICAL COMPOSITION BY DAVID. MAY GOD ANSWER YOU ON THE DAY OF YOUR DISTRESS. MAY THE NAME OF THE GOD OF JACOB FORTIFY YOU. MAY HE SEND YOUR HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY AND SUPPORT YOU FROM ZION. MAY HE RECALL ALL YOUR OFFERINGS AND FAVOR YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS FOREVER. MAY HE GRANT YOU YOUR HEART’S DESIRE AND FULFILL YOUR EVERY DESIGN. MAY WE EXULT IN YOUR DELIVERANCE AND RAISE OUR BANNER IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD. MAY GOD FULFILL ALL OF YOUR DESIRES. NOW I KNOW THAT GOD HAS DELIVERED HIS ANOINTED ONE. HE ANSWERS FROM HIS HOLY HEAVENS, WITH THE MIGHTY SAVING POWER OF HIS RIGHT HAND. SOME COME WITH CHARIOTS AND OTHERS WITH HORSES, BUT WE INVOKE THE NAME OF GOD, OUR LORD. THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR KNEES AND FELL, BUT WE AROSE AND WERE INVIGORATED. GOD, DELIVER US. MAY THE KING ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL.</h1>

<h1>
    “A REDEEMER WILL COME TO ZION AND TO THE PEOPLE OF JACOB WHO REPENT OF THEIR SIN,” DECLARES GOD. “AS FOR ME, THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM,” SAYS GOD: “MY SPIRIT WHICH IS UPON YOU AND MY WORDS WHICH I HAVE PLACED IN YOUR MOUTH, SHALL NOT DEPART FROM YOUR MOUTH, THE MOUTHS OF YOUR CHILDREN, AND THE MOUTHS OF YOUR CHILDREN’S CHILDREN,” DECLARES GOD, “FROM NOW UNTIL ETERNITY.” YOU, HOLY ONE, ARE ENTHRONED UPON THE PRAISES OF ISRAEL. AND THE SERAPHIM CALLED TO EACH OTHER, SAYING, “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY IS GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS; THE ENTIRE EARTH IS FILLED WITH HIS GLORY.” AND, HAVING RECEIVED SANCTION FROM ONE ANOTHER, THEY SAY: “HOLY IN THE LOFTIEST, MOST SUBLIME HEAVENS, THE ABODE OF HIS PRESENCE; HOLY ON EARTH, THE WORK OF HIS MIGHT, HOLY FOREVER AND FOR ALL ETERNITY IS GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS, THE ENTIRE EARTH IS FILLED WITH THE RADIANCE OF HIS GLORY.” AND A WIND BORE ME, AND BEHIND ME I HEARD A GREAT VOICE RESONATING LOUDLY, “BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF GOD FROM ITS PLACE.” AND A WIND BORE ME AND I HEARD BEHIND ME THE MIGHTY TREMBLING VOICE OF THOSE WHO UTTER PRAISES, SAYING, “BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF GOD FROM THE PLACE WHERE HIS PRESENCE ABIDES.” GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER. THE KINGDOM OF GOD ENDURES FOREVER AND EVER. GOD, THE LORD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND ISRAEL, OUR FATHERS, KEEP THIS PRAISE FOREVER AS THE IMPULSE OF THE THOUGHTS OF THE HEARTS OF YOUR PEOPLE, AND DIRECT THEIR HEARTS TO YOU. AND HE IS COMPASSIONATE, FORGIVING OF SIN, AND WILL NOT DESTROY. MANY TIMES HE WITHDRAWS HIS ANGER AND DOES NOT FULLY AROUSE HIS WRATH. FOR YOU, GOD, ARE GOOD AND FORGIVING, ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS TO ALL WHO CALL UPON YOU. YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS ETERNAL RIGHTEOUSNESS; YOUR TORAH IS TRUTH. GRANT TRUTH TO JACOB, KINDNESS TO ABRAHAM, AS YOU HAVE SWORN TO OUR FATHERS FROM ANCIENT TIMES. BLESSED IS GOD WHO LOADS US WITH GOODNESS DAY BY DAY; GOD IS OUR DELIVERANCE FOR ALL TIME. GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS, IS WITH US; THE GOD OF JACOB WILL BE A STRONGHOLD FOR US FOREVER. O GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS, FORTUNATE IS THE PERSON WHO TRUSTS IN YOU. GOD, DELIVER US! MAY THE KING ANSWER US ON THE DAY WE CALL. BLESSED IS HE, OUR GOD, WHO CREATED US FOR HIS GLORY, SEPARATED US FROM THOSE WHO GO ASTRAY, GAVE US THE TORAH OF TRUTH, AND IMPLANTED ETERNAL LIFE WITHIN US. MAY HE OPEN OUR HEARTS TO HIS TORAH, PLACE HIS LOVE AND HIS FEAR IN OUR HEARTS AND INSPIRE US TO CARRY OUT HIS WILL AND SERVE HIM WHOLEHEARTEDLY, SO THAT WE WILL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, NOR BE ALARMED BY BEARING CHILDREN WHO WILL NOT ENDURE. AND SO, MAY IT BE YOUR WILL GOD, OUR LORD, AND LORD OF OUR FATHERS, THAT WE OBSERVE YOUR STATUTES IN THIS WORLD, AND THAT WE MERIT, LIVE, SEE, AND INHERIT GOOD AND BLESSING IN THE ERA OF MASHIACH AND THE LIFE OF THE WORLD TO COME – SO THAT MY SOUL WILL PLAY MUSIC FOR YOUR GLORY AND NOT FALL SILENT; GOD MY LORD, I WILL THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOU FOREVER. BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN GOD, AND GOD WILL BE HIS ASSURANCE. TRUST IN GOD FOREVER AND EVER, FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE WORLDS IS IN GOD THE LORD. THOSE WHO KNOW YOUR NAME WILL PUT THEIR TRUST IN YOU, BECAUSE, YOU, GOD, HAVE NOT ABANDONED THOSE WHO SEEK YOU. GOD DESIRED, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, TO MAKE THE TORAH GREAT AND GLORIOUS.

    A PRAYER BY DAVID. INCLINE YOUR EAR, O GOD, AND ANSWER ME, FOR I AM POOR AND DESTITUTE. GUARD MY SOUL, BECAUSE I AM PIOUS. YOU, MY GOD, DELIVER YOUR SERVANT, WHO TRUSTS IN YOU. BE GRACIOUS UNTO ME, MY GOD, FOR TO YOU I CALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. GLADDEN THE SOUL OF YOUR SERVANT, BECAUSE TO YOU, MY GOD, I RAISE UP MY SOUL. FOR YOU, MY GOD, ARE GOOD AND FORGIVING; YOU ARE ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS TO ALL WHO CALL UPON YOU. LEND YOUR EAR, O GOD, TO MY PRAYER; HEED THE VOICE OF MY SUPPLICATIONS. ON THE DAY OF MY DISTRESS, I CALL OUT TO YOU, FOR YOU WILL ANSWER ME. THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU MY GOD AMONG THE SUPERNAL POWERS, AND THERE ARE NO WORKS LIKE YOURS. ALL THE NATIONS THAT YOU HAVE MADE WILL COME AND PROSTRATE THEMSELVES BEFORE YOU, MY GOD, AND WILL HONOR YOUR NAME. THEY WILL SAY THAT YOU ARE GREAT AND WORK WONDERS – YOU, GOD, ALONE. SHOW ME YOUR WAY, O GOD, SO THAT I MAY WALK IN THE PATH OF YOUR TRUTH; UNIFY MY HEART TO FEAR YOUR NAME. I WILL THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOU, MY GOD, MY LORD, WITH ALL MY HEART; I WILL HONOR YOUR NAME FOREVER, FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME HAS BEEN GREAT, AND YOU HAVE SAVED MY SOUL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAVE. O GOD, THE BRAZEN HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST ME, AND A COMPANY OF RUTHLESS MEN HAVE SOUGHT MY SOUL; THEY ARE NOT MINDFUL OF YOU. YOU, MY GOD, ARE ALMIGHTY, MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS, SLOW TO ANGER, ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS AND TRUE. TURN TO ME AND BE GRACIOUS UNTO ME; ENDOW YOUR SERVANT WITH YOUR STRENGTH AND DELIVER THE SON OF YOUR HANDMAIDEN. GRANT ME A SIGN OF FAVOR SO THAT MY FOES WILL SEE AND BE ASHAMED, FOR YOU, GOD, HAVE HELPED ME AND COMFORTED ME.

<h3>The First Day:</h3>
<h1>TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES SERVING IN THE TEMPLE WOULD SAY:</h1>
<h1>A PSALM BY DAVID. THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS, THE WORLD AND ALL ITS INHABITANTS, ARE GOD’S. HE ESTABLISHED IT UPON THE SEAS AND POSITIONED IT FIRMLY UPON THE RIVERS. WHO MAY ASCEND THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD? WHO MAY STAND IN HIS HOLY PLACE? HE WHO HAS CLEAN HANDS AND A PURE HEART AND WHO HAS NOT TAKEN MY NAME IN VAIN, NOR TAKEN A DECEITFUL OATH. HE WILL RECEIVE A BLESSING FROM GOD AND DUE KINDNESS FROM THE LORD OF HIS SALVATION. SUCH IS THE GENERATION OF THOSE WHO SEEK HIM, THE DESCENDANTS OF JACOB, WHO CONSTANTLY SEEK YOUR COUNTENANCE. LIFT UP YOUR HEADS, O GATES; BE RAISED HIGH, YOU ETERNAL PORTALS, SO THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY ENTER. WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY? GOD, WHO IS STRONG AND MIGHTY; GOD, WHO IS MIGHTY IN WAR. LIFT UP YOUR HEADS, O GATES; LIFT YOURSELVES UP, O THE ETERNAL PORTALS, SO THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY ENTER. WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY? GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS; HE IS THE KING OF GLORY FOREVER.</h1>

<h3>The Second Day:</h3>
<h1>
    TODAY IS THE SECOND DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES SERVING IN THE TEMPLE WOULD SAY:
</h1>

<h1>
    A SONG, A PSALM, BY THE SONS OF KORACH. GOD IS GREAT AND EXCEEDINGLY PRAISED IN THE CITY OF OUR LORD, HIS HOLY MOUNTAIN. A BEAUTIFUL VISTA, THE JOY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD, IS MOUNT ZION, ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE GREAT KING’S CITY. IN ITS PALACES, GOD HAS BECOME KNOWN AS A STRONGHOLD. FOR BEHOLD, KINGS TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER. THEY PROCEEDED TOGETHER IN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER. THEY SAW AND THEY WERE AMAZED. THEY WERE TERROR-STRUCK AND HASTILY FLED. TREMBLING TOOK HOLD OF THEM THERE, PANGS LIKE THOSE OF A WOMAN IN LABOR. WITH AN EAST WIND, YOU SHATTERED THE SHIPS OF TARSHISH. AS WE HEARD, SO HAVE WE ACTUALLY SEEN, IN THE CITY OF GOD, COMMANDER OF LEGIONS, THE CITY OF OUR GOD. MAY GOD ESTABLISH IT FOR ETERNITY, SELAH. GOD, WE HAVE LONGED TO SEE YOUR KINDNESS MANIFEST WITHIN YOUR SANCTUARY. AS YOUR NAME, O GOD, IS GREAT, SO, TOO, IS YOUR PRAISE, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. YOUR RIGHT HAND IS FILLED WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS. MAY MOUNT ZION REJOICE AND THE DAUGHTERS OF JUDAH BE GLAD, BECAUSE OF YOUR JUDGMENTS. WALK AROUND ZION, ENCIRCLE HER, COUNT HER TOWERS. TAKE NOTE OF HER RAMPART, LOOK UP TO HER PALACES, SO THAT YOU MAY NARRATE THIS TO A LATER GENERATION – BECAUSE THIS GOD IS OUR GOD FOREVER AND EVER. HE WILL LEAD US FOREVER.
</h1>
<h1>
    DELIVER US, GOD OUR LORD, GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS, SO THAT WE MAY THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE. BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME – AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, “AMEN, PRAISE GOD!” BLESSED IS GOD FROM ZION, WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM. PRAISE GOD!

</h1>

<h3>The Third Day:</h3>
<h1>
    TODAY IS THE THIRD DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES ON DUTY IN THE TEMPLE USED TO SAY:
</h1>
<h1>
    A PSALM BY ASAF. GOD STANDS IN THE ASSEMBLAGE OF THE ALMIGHTY. AMONG THE JUDGES, HE RENDERS JUDGMENT. UNTIL WHEN WILL YOU JUDGE CROOKEDLY AND CONTINUALLY SHOW FAVOR TO THE WICKED? RENDER JUSTICE TO THE POOR AND THE ORPHAN. VINDICATE THE DESTITUTE AND THE NEEDY. RESCUE THE POOR AND THE INDIGENT. SAVE THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE WICKED. PERVERSE JUDGES DO NOT KNOW, NOR DO THEY UNDERSTAND. THEY WALK IN DARKNESS. BECAUSE OF THEM, ALL THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD COLLAPSE. I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE LIKE GOD. THAT YOU ARE ALL LIKE THE SUBLIME ANGELS. BUT LIKE ADAM YOU SHALL DIE, AND LIKE ONE OF THE PRINCES, YOU WILL FALL. ARISE, O GOD, JUDGE THE EARTH, FOR YOU ALLOT THE INHERITANCE OF ALL THE NATIONS.
</h1>
<h1>
    DELIVER US, GOD OUR LORD, GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS, SO THAT WE MAY THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE. BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME – AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, “AMEN, PRAISE GOD!” BLESSED IS GOD FROM ZION, WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM. PRAISE GOD! BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, WHO ALONE PERFORMS WONDERS. BLESSED BE HIS GLORIOUS NAME FOREVER, MAY HIS GLORY FILL THE ENTIRE EARTH. AMEN AND AMEN.
</h1>

<h3>The Fourth Day:</h3>
<h1>
    TODAY IS THE FOURTH DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES SERVING IN THE TEMPLE WOULD SAY:
</h1>
<h1>
    O LORD, GOD OF VENGEANCE. O GOD OF VENGEANCE, REVEAL YOURSELF. SHOW YOUR LOFTINESS, O JUDGE OF THE EARTH. BRING RETRIBUTION UPON THE PROUD. UNTIL WHEN SHALL THE WICKED, O GOD – UNTIL WHEN SHALL THE WICKED EXULT? THEY FREELY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND SPEAK INSOLENTLY. ALL THE WORKERS OF INIQUITY GLORIFY THEMSELVES. THEY CRUSH YOUR PEOPLE, O GOD, AND OPPRESS YOUR HERITAGE. THEY KILL THE WIDOW AND THE STRANGER AND MURDER ORPHANS. THEY SAY: “GOD DOES NOT SEE, NOR DOES THE GOD OF JACOB PAY HEED.” FOOLS AMONG THE PEOPLE, UNDERSTAND. WHEN, SENSELESS ONES, WILL YOU GROW WISE? SHALL HE WHO IMPLANTS THE EAR NOT HEAR? SHALL HE WHO FORMS THE EYE NOT SEE? SHALL HE WHO CHASTISES NATIONS NOT REBUKE THE WICKED? HE GRANTS MAN UNDERSTANDING. SHALL HE NOT KNOW HIS THOUGHTS? GOD KNOWS THE THOUGHTS OF MAN, THAT THEY ARE EMPTINESS. FORTUNATE IS THE MAN WHOM YOU CHASTISE, O G-D, AND WHOM YOU INSTRUCT FROM YOUR TORAH, SO THAT HE IS GRANTED TRANQUILITY AND SPARED FROM THE DAYS OF EVIL UNTIL A PIT IS DUG FOR THE WICKED. FOR GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS PEOPLE, NOR WILL HE ABANDON HIS HERITAGE. FOR THE JUDGMENT OF RETRIBUTION WILL CONTINUALLY BE VISITED UNTIL RIGHTEOUSNESS IS REACHED. AFTERWARDS, ALL WILL BE UPRIGHT OF HEART. WHO WILL RISE UP ON MY BEHALF AGAINST THE DOERS OF EVIL? WHO WILL STAND ON MY BEHALF AGAINST THE WORKERS OF INIQUITY? HAD GOD NOT BEEN MY HELP, MY SOUL WOULD SOON HAVE DWELT IN THE SILENCE OF THE GRAVE. WHEN I SAID, “MY FOOT FALTERS,” YOUR KINDNESS, O GOD, SUPPORTED ME. WHEN MY BOTHERSOME THOUGHTS ABOUNDED WITHIN ME, YOUR CONSOLATION BROUGHT DELIGHT TO MY SOUL. CAN THE THRONE OF THE WORKERS OF DESTRUCTION, WHO MAKE INIQUITY LAW, BE COMPARED TO YOU?! THEY JOIN TOGETHER AGAINST THE SOUL OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN, AND THEY CONDEMN THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT. GOD HAS BEEN MY FORTRESS, AND MY LORD, THE ROCK OF MY SHELTER. GOD WILL TURN THEIR VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND WITH THEIR OWN EVIL, HE WILL CUT THEM OFF. GOD OUR LORD WILL SURELY CUT THEM OFF. COME, LET US SING JOYOUSLY TO GOD. LET US CALL OUT TO THE ROCK OF OUR DELIVERANCE IN JUBILATION. LET US GREET HIM WITH THANKSGIVING. LET US CALL OUT TO HIM WITH SINGING. FOR THE LORD IS A GREAT GOD, AND A GREAT KING OVER ALL SUPERNAL BEINGS.
</h1>
<h1>
    DELIVER US, GOD OUR LORD, GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS, SO THAT WE MAY THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE. BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME – AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, “AMEN, PRAISE GOD!” BLESSED IS GOD FROM ZION, WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM. PRAISE GOD! BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, WHO ALONE PERFORMS WONDERS. BLESSED BE HIS GLORIOUS NAME FOREVER, MAY HIS GLORY FILL THE ENTIRE EARTH. AMEN AND AMEN.

<h3>The Fifth Day:</h3>
<h1>
    TODAY IS THE FIFTH DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES SERVING IN THE TEMPLE WOULD SAY:
</h1>
<h1>
    TO THE LEAD MUSICIAN, ON THE GITTIS, BY ASAF. SING JOYOUSLY TO GOD, OUR STRENGTH, SOUND THE SHOFAR BEFORE THE GOD OF JACOB. RAISE YOUR VOICE IN SONG, SOUND THE DRUM, THE PLEASANT-SOUNDING HARP AND THE LYRE. SOUND THE SHOFAR AT THE NEW MOON, THE APPOINTED TIME FOR OUR FESTIVAL. FOR IT IS A STATUTE FOR ISRAEL, A DAY OF JUDGMENT BEFORE THE GOD OF JACOB. HE ESTABLISHED IT AS A TESTIMONIAL RECALLING JOSEPH, WHEN HE WENT FORTH AS A RULER OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT AND SAID, “I HEARD A LANGUAGE THAT I DID NOT KNOW.” I (GOD) FREED HIS SHOULDER OF THE BURDEN, AND HIS HANDS OF THE PRISONER’S CAULDRON. IN DISTRESS, YOU CALLED OUT AND I RELEASED YOU. WHILE YOU CALLED TO ME IN HIDING, I ANSWERED YOU WITH THUNDER, EVEN THOUGH I TESTED YOU AT THE WATERS OF MERIVAH, SELAH. LISTEN, MY PEOPLE, AND I WILL CAUTION YOU. ISRAEL, IF YOU WOULD ONLY HEED ME! LET THERE BE NO STRANGE GODS WITHIN YOU, NOR SHALL YOU BOW DOWN TO A FOREIGN DEITY. I AM GOD, YOUR LORD, WHO LIFTED YOU UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT. OPEN WIDE YOUR MOUTH TO STATE YOUR DESIRES AND I WILL FULFILL THEM. BUT MY PEOPLE DID NOT HEED MY VOICE. ISRAEL DID NOT DESIRE TO LISTEN TO ME. SO I SENT THEM AFTER THE ILLUSIONS OF THEIR HEART. LET THEM FOLLOW THEIR OWN COUNSELS. IF ONLY MY PEOPLE WOULD HEED ME. IF ONLY ISRAEL WOULD WALK IN MY WAYS! I WOULD SUBDUE THEIR ENEMIES WITHOUT DELAY AND TURN MY HAND AGAINST THEIR FOES. THOSE WHO HATE GOD WILL DENY HIM. THE TIME OF THEIR RETRIBUTION WILL ENDURE FOREVER. HE (GOD) WOULD FEED HIM FROM THE CREAM OF WHEAT, AND GOD PROMISES THAT “FROM THE ROCK, I WILL SATIATE YOU WITH HONEY.”
</h1>
<h1>
    DELIVER US, GOD OUR LORD, GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS, SO THAT WE MAY THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE. BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME – AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, “AMEN, PRAISE GOD!” BLESSED IS GOD FROM ZION, WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM. PRAISE GOD! BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, WHO ALONE PERFORMS WONDERS. BLESSED BE HIS GLORIOUS NAME FOREVER, MAY HIS GLORY FILL THE ENTIRE EARTH. AMEN AND AMEN.
</h1>

<h3>The Sixth Day:</h3>
<h1>
    TODAY IS THE SIXTH DAY OF THE WEEK, ON WHICH THE LEVITES SERVING IN THE TEMPLE WOULD SAY:
</h1>
<h1>
    GOD HAS REIGNED. HE HAS GARBED HIMSELF IN GRANDEUR. GOD HAS GARBED HIMSELF, AND GIRDED HIMSELF WITH STRENGTH. THE WORLD IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED, SO THAT IT WILL NOT FALTER. YOUR THRONE STANDS FIRM FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. YOU HAVE EXISTED FOREVER. THE RIVERS HAVE RAISED, O GOD – THE RIVERS HAVE RAISED THEIR VOICE. THE RIVERS RAISE THEIR CRUSHING WAVES. MORE THAN THE SOUND OF MANY WATERS, MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BREAKERS OF THE SEA, IS GOD MIGHTY ON HIGH. YOUR TESTIMONIES ARE MOST TRUSTWORTHY. YOUR HOUSE WILL BE RESPLENDENT IN HOLINESS, O GOD, UNTIL THE END OF DAYS.
</h1>
<h1>
    DELIVER US, GOD OUR LORD, GATHER US FROM AMONG THE NATIONS, SO THAT WE MAY THANKFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY IN YOUR PRAISE. BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, FROM THIS WORLD UNTIL THE WORLD TO COME – AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, “AMEN, PRAISE GOD!” BLESSED IS GOD FROM ZION, WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM. PRAISE GOD! BLESSED IS GOD, THE LORD, THE LORD OF ISRAEL, WHO ALONE PERFORMS WONDERS. BLESSED BE HIS GLORIOUS NAME FOREVER, MAY HIS GLORY FILL THE ENTIRE EARTH. AMEN AND AMEN.
</h1>

<h3 class="hint">On Rosh Chodesh say:</h3>
<h1 class="hint">
    MY SOUL, PRAISE GOD! GOD, MY LORD, YOU ARE SUBLIMELY EXALTED: YOU HAVE DONNED GLORY AND SPLENDOR. YOU WRAP THE WORLD IN LIGHT AS WITH A GARMENT. YOU SPREAD THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN. HE ROOFS HIS LOFTY CHAMBERS WITH WATER. HE MAKES THE CLOUDS HIS CHARIOT. HE SPEEDS THEM ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND. HE MAKES THE WINDS HIS MESSENGERS. FLASHES OF FIRE, HIS ATTENDANTS. HE ESTABLISHED THE EARTH ON ITS FOUNDATIONS, SO THAT IT WILL NOT FALTER FOR ETERNITY. YOU COVERED IT WITH THE WATERY DEPTHS AS WITH A GARMENT. THE WATERS STAND ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. FROM YOUR REBUKE, THEY FLEE. FROM THE RUMBLE OF YOUR THUNDER, THEY RUSH AWAY. THEY ASCEND MOUNTAINS. THEY DESCEND INTO VALLEYS, TO THE PLACE YOU ESTABLISHED FOR THEM. YOU SET A BOUNDARY OVER WHICH THEY CANNOT PASS, SO THAT THEY WILL NOT RETURN AND COVER THE EARTH. YOU SEND FORTH SPRINGS INTO STREAMS THAT MAKE THEIR WAY BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS. THEY WATER ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD. THE WILD ANIMALS QUENCH THEIR THIRST. THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS DWELL OVER THEM. FROM AMONG THE FOLIAGE, THEY RAISE THEIR VOICES. HE WATERS THE MOUNTAINS FROM HIS LOFTY CHAMBERS. YEA, THE EARTH IS SATIATED FROM THE FRUIT OF YOUR WORK. YOU MAKE GRASS GROW FOR CATTLE, VEGETATION WHICH REQUIRES MAN’S WORK, TO PRODUCE FOOD FROM THE EARTH. AND WINE THAT GLADDENS THE HEART OF MAN, OIL THAT MAKES A FACE GLOW, AND BREAD THAT SUSTAINS THE HEART OF MAN. THE TREES OF GOD ARE SATIATED, THE CEDARS OF LEBANON THAT HE PLANTED. THERE BIRDS MAKE THEIR NEST. THE STORK MAKES ITS HOME AMONG THE CYPRESS. HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE THE HOME OF THE WILD GOATS. THE CRAGS ARE A REFUGE FOR THE RABBITS. HE MADE THE MOON TO INDICATE THE FESTIVALS. THE SUN KNOWS THE TIME OF ITS SETTING. YOU BRING ON DARKNESS AND IT BECOMES NIGHT, WHEN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST PROWL. THE YOUNG LIONS ROAR FOR PREY, TO SEEK THEIR FOOD FROM THE ALMIGHTY. WHEN THE SUN SHINES FORTH, THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DOWN IN THEIR DENS. AND AT THAT TIME, MAN GOES OUT TO HIS WORK, TO HIS LABOR UNTIL EVENING. HOW MANIFOLD ARE YOUR WORKS, O GOD! YOU HAVE MADE THEM ALL WITH WISDOM. THE EARTH IS FILLED WITH YOUR POSSESSIONS. BEHOLD THIS SEA, SO VAST AND BROAD, WHERE THERE ARE COUNTLESS CREEPING THINGS, LIVING BEINGS BOTH SMALL AND LARGE. THERE SHIPS MAKE THEIR WAY. IN IT IS THE LEVIASAN THAT YOU CREATED TO FROLIC WITH. THEY ALL LOOK HOPEFULLY TO YOU, TO GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD IN ITS TIME. WHEN YOU GRANT IT TO THEM, THEY COLLECT IT. WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HAND, THEY ARE SATIATED WITH GOODNESS. WHEN YOU GRANT IT TO THEM, THEY COLLECT IT. WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HAND, THEY ARE SATIATED WITH GOODNESS. WHEN YOU HIDE YOUR FACE, THEY ARE DISMAYED. WHEN THEIR SPIRITS EXPIRE, THEY PERISH AND RETURN TO THEIR DUST. WHEN YOU SEND FORTH YOUR SPIRIT, THEY ARE CREATED ANEW. YOU RENEW THE FACE OF THE EARTH. MAY THE GLORY OF GOD ENDURE FOREVER. MAY GOD REJOICE IN HIS WORKS. HE LOOKS TO THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES. HE TOUCHES THE MOUNTAINS AND THEY SMOKE. I SHALL SING TO GOD WHILE I LIVE. I SHALL MAKE MUSIC TO MY LORD WHILE I EXIST. MAY MY WORDS BE PLEASANT TO HIM. I SHALL REJOICE IN GOD. MAY SINNERS CEASE FROM THE EARTH AND THE WICKED BE NO MORE. MY SOUL, BLESS GOD! PRAISE GOD.
</h1>

<h3>The following Psalm is said from the first day of Rosh-Chodesh in the month of Elul up to and including Hoshan Rabbah:</h3>
<h1 class="hint">BY DAVID. GOD IS MY LIGHT AND MY DELIVERANCE. WHOM SHALL I FEAR? GOD IS THE STRENGTH OF MY LIFE, WHOM SHALL I DREAD? WHEN EVILDOERS APPROACHED ME TO CONSUME MY FLESH, MY TORMENTORS AND MY ENEMIES, IT IS THEY WHO STUMBLED AND FELL. IF AN ARMED CAMP WOULD BESIEGE ME, MY HEART WOULD NOT FEAR. IF A WAR WOULD ARISE AGAINST ME, I TRUST IN THIS. ONE THING I HAVE ASKED OF GOD, THIS I REQUEST: THAT I DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF GOD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, SO THAT I MAY BEHOLD THE PLEASANTNESS OF GOD AND VISIT HIS BEIS HAMIKDASH. FOR HE WILL HIDE ME IN HIS SHELTER ON THE DAY OF ADVERSITY. HE WILL CONCEAL ME IN THE HIDDEN REACHES OF HIS TENT AND RAISE ME UP ON A ROCK. MY HEAD WILL THEN BE RAISED ABOVE MY ENEMIES AROUND ME AND I WILL SACRIFICE OFFERINGS OF JUBILATION IN HIS TABERNACLE. I WILL SING AND I WILL MAKE MUSIC TO GOD. HEAR MY VOICE, O GOD, WHEN I CALL. BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND ANSWER ME. ON YOUR BEHALF, MY HEART SAYS: “SEEK MY COUNTENANCE”. I WILL SEEK YOUR COUNTENANCE, O GOD. DO NOT CONCEAL YOUR FACE FROM ME. DO NOT SPURN YOUR SERVANT IN ANGER. YOU HAVE BEEN MY HELP. DO NOT FORSAKE ME NOR ABANDON ME, O GOD OF MY DELIVERANCE. ALTHOUGH MY FATHER AND MOTHER HAVE ABANDONED ME, GOD WILL TAKE ME IN. O GOD, TEACH ME YOUR WAY AND GUIDE ME IN THE PATH OF UPRIGHTNESS, BECAUSE OF MY WATCHFUL ENEMIES. DO NOT SURRENDER ME TO THE WISHES OF MY TORMENTORS, FOR FALSE WITNESSES HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME, ADVOCATING VIOLENCE. HAD I NOT TRUSTED THAT I WOULD YET SEE THE GOODNESS OF GOD IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING. PUT YOUR HOPE IN GOD. BE STRONG, LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE, AND PUT YOUR HOPE IN GOD.</h1>

<h1>RABBI NASSAN, THE BABYLONIAN SAYS: A MINUTE AMOUNT OF JORDANIAN AMBER WAS ALSO ADDED. IF HONEY WAS ADDED, THE OFFERING BECAME DISQUALIFIED. IF ONE OMITTED ANY OF ITS SPICES, HE WAS LIABLE TO THE DEATH PENALTY.</h1>
<h1>RABBAN SHIMON BEN GAMLIEL SAYS: STACTE IS SIMPLY THE SAP THAT DRIPS FROM THE BALSAM TREE. CARSHINA LYE WAS USED TO RUB ON THE ONYCHA TO IMPROVE ITS APPEARANCE. WINE FROM CYPRUS SERVED FOR STEEPING THE ONYCHA, TO INTENSIFY ITS FRAGRANCE.

<h1>
    IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO PRAISE THE MASTER OF EVERYTHING, TO ASCRIBE GREATNESS TO THE PRIMAL CREATOR FOR NOT MAKING US LIKE THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, NOR CAUSING US TO BE LIKE THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH, FOR HE HAS NOT ENDOWED US WITH A PORTION LIKE THEIRS, NOR MADE OUR LOT LIKE THAT OF THEIR MULTITUDES. FOR THEY PROSTRATE THEMSELVES BEFORE VANITY AND NOTHINGNESS. BUT WE BEND THE KNEE, PROSTRATE OURSELVES, AND GIVE THANKS BEFORE THE KING OF KINGS, THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. FOR HE EXTENDS THE HEAVENS AND ESTABLISHES THE EARTH. THE SEAT OF HIS GLORY IS IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND THE ABODE OF HIS STRENGTH IS IN THE LOFTIEST HEIGHTS. HE IS OUR GOD, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. OUR KING IS TRUE. ASIDE FROM HIM, THERE IS NOTHING. AS IT IS WRITTEN IN HIS TORAH: “KNOW THIS DAY AND TAKE UNTO YOUR HEART THAT GOD IS THE LORD IN THE HEAVENS ABOVE AND UPON THE EARTH BELOW, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.”
</h1>

<h1>
    WE THEREFORE PUT OUR HOPE IN YOU, GOD, OUR LORD, THAT WE MAY SPEEDILY BEHOLD THE SPLENDOR OF YOUR MIGHT, THAT YOU REMOVE IDOLS FROM THE EARTH, SO THAT THE FALSE DEITIES WILL BE UTTERLY CUT OFF, TO PERFECT THE WORLD UNDER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ALMIGHTY. ALL FLESH WILL INVOKE YOUR NAME, CAUSING ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH TO TURN TO YOU. ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH WILL RECOGNIZE AND KNOW THAT EVERY KNEE SHOULD BEND TO YOU, THAT EVERY TONGUE SHOULD SWEAR BY YOUR NAME. BEFORE YOU, GOD, OUR LORD, THEY WILL KNEEL AND PROSTRATE THEMSELVES AND GIVE HONOR TO THE GLORY OF YOUR NAME. THEY WILL ALL ACCEPT UPON THEMSELVES THE YOKE OF YOUR KINGDOM. MAY YOU SPEEDILY REIGN OVER THEM FOREVER AND EVER. FOR SOVEREIGNTY IS YOURS AND TO ALL ETERNITY YOU WILL REIGN IN GLORY, AS IT IS WRITTEN IN YOUR TORAH: “GOD WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER.” AND IT IS SAID: “GOD SHALL BE KING OVER THE ENTIRE EARTH. ON THAT DAY, GOD WILL BE ONE, AND HIS NAME, ONE.”

    DO NOT FEAR SUDDEN TERROR, NOR THE RAVAGING DISASTER OF THE WICKED SHOULD IT COME. THEY CONTRIVE A SCHEME, BUT IT WILL BE FOILED. THEY TALK OF A PLOT, BUT IT WILL NOT MATERIALIZE, BECAUSE GOD IS WITH US. UNTIL YOUR OLD AGE, I AM WITH YOU, AND UNTIL YOUR HOARY YEARS, I WILL SUSTAIN YOU. I MADE YOU, AND I WILL CARRY YOU, I WILL BEAR YOU AND DELIVER YOU.

<h3>There is a custom after the morning prayer to put on the Tefillin de-Rabbeinu Tam, without a blessing, and to recite the prayer "Hear, O Israel" in them. It is also customary to recite the following texts and then the Six Remembrances.</h3>

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:50px;">HEAR, O YISRAEL, G-D IS OUR L-RD, G-D IS ONE.</h1>
<h3 class="hint">In a whisper:</h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:50px;">BLESSED BE THE NAME OF HIS GLORIOUS KINGDOM FOREVER AND EVER.</h1>

<h1>YOU SHALL LOVE G-D YOUR L-RD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT. THESE WORDS THAT I COMMAND YOU TODAY SHALL BE ON YOUR HEART. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM DILIGENTLY TO YOUR CHILDREN AND SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT AT HOME, WHEN YOU WALK ON THE WAY, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. YOU SHALL BIND THEM AS A SIGN ON YOUR ARM AND AS AN ORNAMENT BETWEEN YOUR EYES. AND YOU SHALL WRITE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOMES AND YOUR GATES.</h1>

<h1>AND IT WILL BE, IF YOU WILL DILIGENTLY OBEY MY COMMANDMENTS WHICH I ENJOIN UPON YOU THIS DAY, TO LOVE THE L-RD YOUR G-D AND TO SERVE HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, I WILL GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND AT THE PROPER TIME, THE EARLY RAIN AND THE LATE RAIN, AND YOU WILL GATHER IN YOUR GRAIN, YOUR WINE AND YOUR OIL. AND I WILL GIVE GRASS IN YOUR FIELDS FOR YOUR CATTLE, AND YOU WILL EAT AND BE SATED. TAKE CARE LEST YOUR HEART BE LURED AWAY, AND YOU TURN ASTRAY AND WORSHIP ALIEN G-DS AND BOW DOWN TO THEM. FOR THEN THE L-RD'S WRATH WILL FLARE UP AGAINST YOU, AND HE WILL CLOSE THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO RAIN AND THE EARTH WILL NOT YIELD ITS PRODUCE, AND YOU WILL SWIFTLY PERISH FROM THE GOOD LAND WHICH THE L-RD GIVES YOU. THEREFORE, PLACE THESE WORDS OF MINE UPON YOUR HEART AND UPON YOUR SOUL, AND BIND THEM FOR A SIGN ON YOUR HAND, AND THEY SHALL BE FOR A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES. YOU SHALL TEACH THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN, TO SPEAK OF THEM WHEN YOU SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN YOU WALK ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU LIE DOWN AND WHEN YOU RISE. AND YOU SHALL INSCRIBE THEM ON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE AND ON YOUR GATES - SO THAT YOUR DAYS AND THE DAYS OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE PROLONGED ON THE LAND WHICH THE L-RD SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE TO THEM FOR AS LONG AS THE HEAVENS ARE ABOVE THE EARTH.</h1>

<h1>THE L-RD SPOKE TO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND TELL THEM TO MAKE FOR THEMSELVES FRINGES ON THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR GENERATIONS, AND TO ATTACH A THREAD OF BLUE ON THE FRINGE OF EACH CORNER. THEY SHALL BE TO YOU AS TZIZIT, AND YOU SHALL LOOK UPON THEM AND REMEMBER ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE L-RD AND FULFILL THEM, AND YOU WILL NOT FOLLOW AFTER YOUR HEART AND AFTER YOUR EYES BY WHICH YOU GO ASTRAY - SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND FULFILL ALL MY COMMANDMENTS AND BE HOLY TO YOUR G-D. I AM THE L-RD YOUR G-D WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO BE YOUR G-D; I, THE L-RD, AM YOUR G-D. TRULY.</h1>

    GOD SPOKE TO MOSHE, SAYING: “CONSECRATE TO ME EVERY FIRSTBORN, EVERY ONE THAT FIRST OPENS THE WOMB, AMONG THE CHILDREN OF YISRAEL, OF MAN AND OF BEAST. IT BELONGS TO ME.” MOSHE SAID TO THE PEOPLE: “REMEMBER THIS DAY ON WHICH YOU DEPARTED FROM EGYPT, FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. FOR WITH A STRONG HAND, GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THERE, AND THEREFORE NO CHAMETZ SHALL BE EATEN. ON THIS DAY, YOU ARE GOING OUT IN THE MONTH OF SPRING. “WHEN GOD BRINGS YOU TO THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES, THE CHITTITES, THE AMORITES, THE CHIVITES AND THE YEVUSITES, WHICH HE SWORE TO YOUR FATHERS TO GIVE TO YOU, A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY, YOU SHALL PERFORM THIS SERVICE IN THIS MONTH. FOR SEVEN DAYS, YOU SHALL EAT MATZOS, AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY, THERE SHALL BE A FESTIVAL TO GOD. MATZOS SHALL BE EATEN FOR THESE SEVEN DAYS. NO CHAMETZ, NOR ANY LEAVEN, MAY BE SEEN IN YOUR POSSESSION, IN ALL YOUR BORDERS. “AND YOU SHALL TELL YOUR SON ON THAT DAY, SAYING: ‘IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT GOD ACTED FOR MY SAKE WHEN I CAME OUT OF EGYPT.’ AND IT SHALL BE AS A SIGN FOR YOU ON YOUR ARM, AND AS A REMINDER BETWEEN YOUR EYES, SO THAT GOD’S TORAH WILL BE IN YOUR MOUTH, FOR WITH A STRONG ARM, GOD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT. YOU SHALL OBSERVE THIS STATUTE AT ITS DESIGNATED TIME FROM YEAR TO YEAR. “WHEN GOD BRINGS YOU TO THE LAND OF THE CANAANITES, AS HE SWORE TO YOU AND TO YOUR FATHERS, AND GIVES IT TO YOU, YOU SHALL SET APART FOR GOD EVERY FIRST ISSUE OF THE WOMB. AND EVERY MALE FIRSTLING THAT YOUR LIVESTOCK ISSUES SHALL BE GOD’S. “YOU SHALL REDEEM EVERY FIRSTLING DONKEY WITH A LAMB. IF YOU DO NOT REDEEM IT, YOU SHALL HACK ITS NECK. AND YOU SHALL REDEEM EVERY HUMAN FIRSTBORN AMONG YOUR SONS. “AND WHEN, IN TIME TO COME, YOUR SON ASKS YOU, SAYING, ‘WHAT IS THIS?’ YOU SHALL SAY TO HIM: ‘WITH A MIGHTY ARM, GOD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT, FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. AND WHEN PHARAOH STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO RELEASE US, GOD SLEW EVERY FIRSTBORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, THE FIRSTBORN OF BOTH MAN AND BEAST. THEREFORE, I OFFER TO GOD EVERY MALE THAT FIRST OPENS THE WOMB, AND ALL THE FIRSTBORN OF MY SONS I REDEEM.’ “AND THIS SHALL BE A SIGN ON YOUR ARM AND AN ORNAMENT BETWEEN YOUR EYES, FOR GOD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT WITH A STRONG ARM.”
