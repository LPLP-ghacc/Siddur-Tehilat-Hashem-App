    3. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season; its leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.
    4. The wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
    5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

    2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,
    3. Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
    4. He who sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
    5. Then he shall speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury.
    6. But I have set my king on my holy mountain of Zion.
    7. I will tell of the decree; the Lord has said to me, You are my son; this day have I begotten you.
    8. Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
    9. You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
    10. Now therefore be wise, O you kings; be instructed, you judges of the earth.
    11. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
    12. Worship in purity, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, for in a little while his wrath will blaze. Happy are all who put their trust in him.

    6. I laid down and slept; I awoke; for the Lord sustained me.
    7. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves around against me.
    8. Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you have struck all my enemies on the cheek bone; you have broken the teeth of the wicked.

    3. O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.
    4. But know that the Lord has set apart the pious man for himself; the Lord will hear when I call to him.
    5. Tremble, and do not sin; talk with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.
    6. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.

    4. You shall hear my voice in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer to you, and will look up.
    5. For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with you.
    6. The foolish shall not stand in your sight; you hate all evil doers.
    7. You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; the Lord will loathe the bloody and deceitful man.
    8. But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your love; and in your fear I will worship toward your holy temple.
    9. Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before my face.
    10. For there is no truth in their mouth; in their heart there is wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.
    11. Condemn them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.
    12. But let all those who put their trust in you rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because you defend them; let those who love your name be joyful in you.

    4. My soul is also much troubled. And you, O Lord, how long?
    5. Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. Oh save me for the sake of your loving kindness!
    6. For in death there is no remembrance of you. In Sheol who shall give you thanks?
    7. I am weary with my moaning; all night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears.
    8. My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my enemies.
    9. Depart from me, all you evil doers; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.

    4. O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands;

    6. Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; let him tread down my life on the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
    7. Arise, O Lord, in your anger, lift up yourself against the rage of my enemies, and awake for me; you have commanded judgment.
    8. Let the congregation of the peoples be gathered around you; and for their sakes return you on high.
    9. The Lord shall judge the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me.

    14. He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he makes arrows for the pursuers.
    15. Behold, he labors with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and brings forth falsehood.

    3. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, had no comfort, and my pain was stirred up.
    4. My heart was hot within me; while I was musing the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue,
    5. Lord, let me know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.
    6. Behold, you have made my days like handbreadths; and my age is nothing before you; truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
    7. Surely every man walks in a vain show; surely they are disquieted in vain; he heaps up riches, and does not know who shall gather them.
    8. And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you.
    9. Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of the villain.
    10. I am dumb, I do not open my mouth; because it is you who did it.

    4. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
    5. I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my riddle to the lyre.

    7. Those who trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
    8. None of them can by any means ransom his brother, nor give to God a price for him;
    9. For the ransom of their soul is costly, and it ceases for ever;

    11. For when he sees that wise men die, that the fool and the stupid alike perish, and leave their wealth to others,
    12. Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
    13. Nevertheless man does not abide in honor; he is like the beasts that perish.
    14. This is their way in their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

    8. And that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation whose heart was not constant, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
    9. The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
    10. They did not keep the covenant of God, and refused to walk according to his Torah.
    11. And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.
    12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
    13. He parted the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters stand like a heap.
    14. And in the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
    15. He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as from the deep.
    16. He made streams come from the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
    17. And they sinned yet more against him, rebelling against the most High in the wilderness.
    18. And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their craving.
    19. And they spoke against God; they said, Can God spread a table in the wilderness?.
    20. Behold, he struck the rock, so that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? Can he provide meat for his people?.
    21. Therefore the Lord heard this, and was angry; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;.
    22. Because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in his salvation.
    23. Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,.
    24. And rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the grain of heaven.
    25. Man ate the bread of angels; he sent them food in abundance.
    26. He caused an east wind to blow in the sky; and by his power he brought on the south wind.
    27. And he rained meat upon them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea;.
    28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
    29. So they ate, and were well filled; for he gave them their own desire;.
    30. They were not yet sated with their lust. But while their food was still in their mouths,.
    31. The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.
    32. For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in his wondrous works.
    33. Therefore he ended their days with emptiness, and their years with trouble.
    34. When he slew them, then they sought him; and they returned and earnestly sought God.
    35. And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
    36. Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.
    37. For their heart was not constant with him, nor were they faithful in his covenant.
    38. But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; often he turned away his anger, and did not stir up all his wrath.
    39. For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and does not come again.
    40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert!.
    41. And they turned back and tempted God, and pained the Holy One of Israel.
    42. They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he saved them from the enemy.
    43. How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;.
    44. And had turned their rivers into blood; so that they could not drink of their streams.
    45. He sent swarms of gnats among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 46. He gave also their crops to the caterpillar, and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
    47. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
    48. He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
    49. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
    50. He made a path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;.
    51. And struck all the firstborn in Egypt; the first of their strength in the tents of Ham;.
    52. But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
    53. And he led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
    54. And he brought them to his holy border, to the mountain which his right hand had won.
    55. He cast out nations before them, and apportioned to them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
    56. Yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high God, and did not keep his testimonies;.
    57. But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
    58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their carved idols.
    59. When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly loathed Israel;.
    60. So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent where he made his dwelling among men;.
    61. And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
    62. He gave his people over also to the sword; and was angry with his inheritance.
    63. The fire consumed their young men; and their virgins had no marriage songs.
    64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
    65. Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, and like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
    66. And he struck his enemies backward; he put upon them an everlasting reproach.
    67. And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;.
    68. But chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved.
    69. And he built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth which he has established for ever.
    70. And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;.
    71. From following the ewes that had young he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
    72. So he tended them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them with skilful hand.

    1. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have come into your inheritance; your holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
    2. The dead bodies of your servants have they given to be food to the birds of the sky, the flesh of your pious ones to the beasts of the earth.

    7. For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
    8. O do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your tender mercies speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.
    9. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; and save us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.
    10. Why should the nations say, Where is their God? let the revenging of the blood of your servants which is shed be made manifest among the nations, and before our eyes.
    11. Let the groans of the prisoner come before you; according to the greatness of your power preserve those who are appointed to die;.

    7. Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not understand your wonders; they did not remember the multitude of your deeds of loving kindness; and they rebelled against you at the sea, the Red Sea!
    8. But he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make known his mighty power!
    9. And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness!
    10. And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy!
    11. And the waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left!
    12. Then they believed his words; they sang his praise!
    13. They soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel;
    14. But they had wanton cravings in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert!
    15. And he gave them what they asked; but sent leanness into their soul!
    16. And they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord!
    17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram!
    18. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked!
    19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image!
    20. Thus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eats grass!
    21. They forgot God who had saved them, who had done great things in Egypt;
    22. Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea!
    23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses, his chosen one, stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them!
    24. And they despised the pleasant land, they did not believe his word;
    25. And they murmured in their tents, and did not listen to the voice of the Lord!
    26. And he lifted up his hand against them, to make them fall in the wilderness;
    27. And to make their seed fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands!
    28. And they joined themselves to Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead!
    29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their wrong doings; and the plague broke out upon them!
    30. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; and so the plague was stayed!
    31. And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations for evermore!
    32. And they angered him at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes,
    33. Because they angered his spirit, so that he spoke rashly with his lips!
    34. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them;
    35. But they mingled among the nations, and learned to do what they did;
    36. And they served their idols; which became a snare to them!
    37. And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to idols,
    38. And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood!
    39. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and played the harlot in their doings!
    40. And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against his people, and he loathed his own heritage!
    41. And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and those who hated them ruled over them!
    42. And their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand!
    43. Many times he saved them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity!
    44. Nevertheless, when he heard their cry, he regarded their affliction;
    45. And he remembered for them his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his loving kindness!
    46. And he caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive!
    47. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and to triumph in your praise!
    48. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the people say, Amen. Hallelujah!

    3. And gathered them from the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south!
    4. They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city to dwell in!
    5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them!
    6. Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distresses!
    7. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation!

    26. They mount up to the sky, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble!
    27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end!
    28. Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses!
    29. He calms the storm, so that its waves are still!
    30. Then they are glad because they have quiet; and he brings them to their desired haven!
    31. Let them praise the Lord for his loving kindness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
    32. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders!
    33. He turns rivers into a wilderness, and springs of water into dry ground;
    34. A fruitful land into barrenness, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants!
    35. He turns the wilderness into a pool of water, and dry ground into springs of water!
    36. And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city for habitation;
    37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which get a fruitful yield!
    38. And he blesses them, so that they are multiplied greatly; and does not let their cattle decrease!
    39. When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow!
    40. He pours contempt upon nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way!
    41. But he raises the poor high out of affliction, and makes his families like a flock!
    42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop its mouth!

    1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Be not silent, O God of my praise;
    2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue!
    3. They surrounded me with words of hatred; and fought against me without cause!
    4. In return for my love they are my accusers; but I give myself to prayer!
    5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love!
    6. Appoint a wicked man over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand!
    7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin!
    8. Let his days be few; and let another seize his possessions!
    9. Let his children become orphans, and his wife a widow!
    10. Let his children become vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread from their desolate places!
    11. Let the creditor seize everything that he has; and let strangers plunder his labor!
    12. Let there be none to extend kindness to him; nor let there be any to favor his orphaned children!
    13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out!
    14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!
    15. Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth!
    16. Because he did not remember to perform kindness, but pursued the poor and needy man, and the broken hearted to their death!
    17. For he loved cursing, so let it come to him; as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him!
    18. And he clothed himself with cursing as his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones!
    19. Let it be to him as the garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he is girded continually!
    20. Let this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord, and of those who speak evil against my soul!
    21. But you, O God the Lord, do for me for your name’s sake; because your loving kindness is good, save me!
    22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me!
    23. I am gone like the shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust!
    24. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh lacks fatness!
    25. I have become a taunt to them; when they see me, they shake their heads!
    26. Help me, O Lord my God; O save me according to your loving kindness; 27. That they may know that this is your hand; that you, Lord, have done it!
    28. Let them curse, but you bless; when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let your servant rejoice!

    2. We hung our lyres on the willows in its midst.
    3. For there those who carried us away captive required of us a song; and those who tormented us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
    4. How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?
    5. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

    1. To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O Lord, you have searched me, and known me.
    2. You know when I sit down and when I rise up, you understand my thoughts from far away.
    3. You have measured my going and my lying down, and you are acquainted with all my ways.
    4. For before a word is in my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it all.
    5. You have beset me behind and before, and laid your hand upon me.
    6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain it.
    7. Where shall I go from your spirit? Where shall I flee from your presence?
    8. If I ascend up to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
    9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
    10. Even there shall your hand lead me, and your right hand shall hold me.

    14. I will praise you; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are your works! And my soul knows that right well.
    15. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and finely wrought in the depths of the earth.
    16. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; and in your book all things were written; also the days in which they are to be fashioned, and for it too there was one of them.
    17. How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is their sum.
    18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand; when I awake, I am still with you.
    19. Surely you will slay the wicked, O God! Depart from me therefore, you bloody men.

    21. Do I not hate them, O Lord, those who hate you? And do I not strive with those who rise up against you?
    22. I hate them with the utmost hatred; I count them my enemies.
    23. Search me, O God, and know my heart! Test me, and know my thoughts.
